For filepaths, access it using `"~/Box/STAT 222 Capstone"` to ensure code is usable across all machines.

### Conda Environment

The environment `capstone` can be found in [`environment.yml`](https://github.com/current12/Stat-222-Project/blob/main/environment.yml).

If you have the environment activated, you can run `conda env export > environment.yml` while in this directory to update the yaml file.
