      "Analysts: Peter Kafka - Re/code Mark Mahaney - RBC\n",
      "David Wells: Welcome to the Netflix Q3 2015 earnings call. I am David Wells, CFO. Joining me today from the company is Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us today will be Peter Kafka of Re/code; and Mark Mahaney of RBC. Now, today we will be making forward-looking statements, so actual results may vary. I think I am turning it over to you Mark for our first question.\n",
      "Q - Mark Mahaney: Thanks, David. First question has to do with domestic streaming market for Netflix. Sub numbers for the second September quarter in a row came in light, you talked about involuntary churn. Could you give a little bit more color around the source of that sub add weakness? Is this a temporary problem and then just delay concerns that it could be due to greater increased competitive pressure or due to pushback against some of the recently disclosed price increases?\n",
      "David Wells: Sure, I could take this one Mark. I would say that in terms of additions they were pretty strong through the quarter in terms of flat year-over-year. In net additions they were down year-over-year, and that we explained and attributed to our involuntary churn or payments-related churn. We think partially that was due to the transition to the chip cards, which is still ongoing. And we've reflected that trend going forward into Q4 in our guidance. We don't think though that it really affects our addressable market size of 60 million to 90 million. I would say last year we had a little bit of concern at the same time, when we over-forecasted Q3 and we ended up in Q4 delivering up to 6 million subscribers for that year. We've done about 5 million to 6 million for the last four years. So I would say our thesis on the addressable market isn't really changed, isn't changed. And in terms of the involuntary churn, we've been improving that. It's better year-on-year, but it has impacted at our levels even on a small basis, 10 basis points, 20 basis points.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: So next Q3, Mark, you could be sure that we're definitely going to have low guidance in July. So we think it's just the summer part.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: And then, Reed, you've added 6 million net subs for the last four years in the U.S., at some point you can't sustain that, your level. As you look forward to next year and what kind of keeps you in that 5 million to 6 million range, so just address issues like your confidence that the marketplace will accept the price increases. Is it that we should expect a greater amount of original content coming up to help keep that sub add level that 5 million to 6 million. Just address how the consistency of that growth going forward?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: When we look at the last couple of years, where we've been -- last four years, we've been about 6 million net adds in the U.S., and then accelerating number of new members internationally. But restricting the comments to the U.S., it's fundamentally that internet TV is better than linear TV. The consumers can watch when they want, on what type of device they want, and the content has just got better and better. So the fundamental confidence about the large scale is because on-demand is a better experience than linear, and the entire market is going to move from linear to on-demand internet television over the next 10 to 20 years. In terms of the specific, when we look at the shows that we have coming out next year, that gives us a lot of confidence. We have the Disney pay-one deal coming in the U.S. in the third quarter. Third, fourth quarter next year?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Fourth of next year.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: Fourth quarter next year. And so we got just a tremendous content coming in. I am sure there is a lot of competitors, but there always have been. I mean we've competed against cable and satellite, and we've competed against YouTube and all kinds of pay-per-view and DVD. So there is a lot of ways to consume entertainment. And despite all of those, Netflix keeps growing, because we keep improving. So that's why we feel good about next year, both domestic and especially international.\n",
      "David Wells: And then just a narrow point, Mark, on the pricing. I mean, we changed the price in the U.S. last Q2. Q3 came in less than expected, but then we delivered in Q4, and then substantially Q1, Q2 of this year with a higher price. So I don't think you can ascribe that to a price for the U.S. in terms of growth.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: Hey, guys, I want to ask an international question. But first, can you just go back and explain a little more about the involuntary churn and what it was with the credit cards that caused people to be unable to pay? I've got the same account number, what happens when my card type changes, it prevents me from paying. And what didn't you see that happened in Q3?\n",
      "David Wells: Peter, this is David. It's not consistently the case that people don't have the same account number and some issuers are going to replace that number when they issue that. And for us as a recurring merchant, where we really want to reduce the friction of renewal and reduce the friction of having any sort of interaction where we have to update your payment method and present an opportunity not to do that, it just means that there is more noise introduced into that. And we think it's a contributor. Like I said, it's likely multifactor. There may be other things going on here, but certainly the transition to the chip cards is not helping, and that has to be a factor in it. And we're only partially the way through, so the U.S. issuers are going to continue that in Q4. They were supposed to be done in October, and they're not. They're about a-third of the way through. So we'll continue to see that in the U.S., as we go along.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: And gross additions were above forecast, right?\n",
      "David Wells: Correct.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: That's why we're attributing it to the misforecast, which is quite modest, because this is the most accurate forecast we've ever had on an overall basis to this slight change, relative to our forecast in the involuntary churn.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: And you said the international numbers came in where you expected, but you didn't provide any color on sort of which territories are doing better or worse than others. Are there surprises by territory that something do particularly well or particularly underperform?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: They're all doing really well, but some are bigger than others. But for competitive reasons, we don't give per country color. So we are continuing to learn in every market and improving every market. Every market is growing. But some are doing better than others, which you would expect, and that's up to us to manage to get the total portfolio to be as fast growing as they are.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: It's Mark again. So Reed let me ask you one question and then Ted a question to you. Reed, I know in the last earnings call, I think, you cautioned people not to get too robust in the Japan launch. And then also argued there or made the comment that Brazil was like a rocket ship. So at least could you just update maybe a little commentary on those two markets? Our survey work indicated that Brazil was in fact a rocket ship, is that continuing? And then Japan, should we continue to be mellow in terms of modest in terms of the ramp up there?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: It's clearly, clearly undisciplined, my no commentary on countries. So if I said it was a rocket ship that has continued. Brazil what we're seeing is this with a tough economy, a value-based product like Netflix, that's very inexpensive is really appreciated. And so even though there's tight economic times currently, that has not held back our growth. And we were definitely pleased with the content and with the offering that we had. And maybe Ted you can talk a little bit about the Japanese content offering.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Yes. I'd say, even back to Brazil, I mean one of the great upsides, and this was our Global Original series Narcos. The star of Narcos and the Director and Creator of Narcos are both Brazilian superstars. So Brazil has received Narcos particularly well as it's been well-received around the world. In Japan, I think what's been really great too is the local acceptance of our Global Originals. So we're seeing them perform as a percentage of watching, about the same, as they are in other territories, which again defies conventional wisdom that Japan is primarily a local territory. And we hedged a little bit too and had some local Netflix original content in Japan, including a show called Terrace House is doing particularly well too. So I think it's been a great success in being able to make shows for the globe and extend to places as diverse as Brazil and Japan.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: And Narcos is really just such an incredible story, because it's two-thirds in Spanish, and that was a huge success for us around the world, including France and Norway. And so it really speaks a lot to our ability to connect the world to do amazing shows around the world that are great stories for everyone.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: And great stories travel.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: Ted on the original content launches, as you're thinking about next year, can you help us think about whether the original content launches as a whole are going to be as impactful, less impactful or more or so than what we're seeing in 2015?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Well, I can tell you that I would say as impactful. I don't know if that'd be more or less. But certainly as we continue to expand into second, third and four seasons of our original shows, what you see there is the franchise value grows dramatically. So as this initiative is aging, the desire to see the new seasons builds up more and more excitement. And we're not waiting for next year for that, we have an amazing launch scheduled for Q4. In the Marvel Defender series, we're bringing out the second show, Jessica Jones in Q4 as an example, which I think is going to spark a lot more interest in the entire Daredevil run, and the next one is coming up after that.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: When we talked about the $5 billion content budget for next year, you said for sure, it was going to have more impact.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: On license content, there's a lot of chatter about some of the studios, networks pulling back for stuff they're licensing to you folks. You guys addressed that in your shareholder letter. You said some content providers may choose to license to you, some may not. Have you seen evidence that people are actively steering content away from Netflix in particular?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: The media business is absolutely influx. As Reed said, you've had this growing move away from linear and towards on-demand, both watching and spending. So the future of how the networks and studios deal with Netflix, and Hulu, and Amazon Prime Instant Video, is certainly going to determine their future. So there is a lot of caution. And you see how volatile the market can be just with a turn of a phrase last quarter. So I think what's happening is, is that you're hearing a lot of chatter, but you see in our earnings letter, we detailed some major global television deals we've signed across the board with our suppliers. You should keep in mind that those particular deals are big rocks to move with our suppliers. Buying and selling global television is a brand new behavior to the industry. So whatever you're seeing is more chatter, but roughly business as usual. But of course, some caution, caution that's been around since we've been licensing streaming content.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: Peter, the caution it's SVOD wide. So when you think about new content on Hulu, I mean Hulu is even more of our cord-cutter's dream than Netflix is, because it's got the network shows day after. So you really want to read it. A lot of the concern is about SVOD generally, which is to be understood.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: But Hulu is owned by three of the major networks, James Murdoch at Fox said he'll be working with you differently. A show like Empire, the biggest show last year is going to Hulu and not to Netflix. Are you seeing any of the Hulu studios in particular steer content away from you and towards Hulu?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Remember we're buying show by show. So what happens is happening on the show level not the supplier level. As Reed said it's particularly puzzling that considering that it's much more disruptive to give commercial free options the day after broadcast and it is the year after broadcast.\n",
      "David Wells: It doesn't address the strategic issue that is supposedly causing the anger with a backlash or the choice not -- \n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: For accelerating cord cutting in that case.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: And the thing to tease out here is, let's say, the Empire creators, they get paid based upon how the show monetizes. So the studio is under an obligation to monetize that as fully as they can. So Hulu can outbid us, as they did on Empire, and that's fair game. But they can't win it at half the bid, because then the participants don't get paid the right amount.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: And I think participants are well in tune with that as well.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: It's Mark. Let me ask two questions. One on the Epix deal and one on some of the background to the price increase you just announced. On the Epix deal maybe, Ted, could you comment on this. So the decision to not renew it, could you just kind of explain that? Was that due to the economics that you thought were going to be part of the deal really didn't come through for you? The cost per viewing hour is too high? Was it that there's a broader movement at Netflix away from feature films? Were there too many restrictions on a renewal? Just kind of explain to us why that deal didn't get renewed?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: So some of our core initiatives around our content are around exclusivity, and accelerating windows and giving consumer access to content earlier and earlier, so the pay TV window has been particularly out of step with consumer desire to watch content when they wanted. And exclusivity, obviously, when we entered into our agreement with Epix, we were kind of de facto exclusive, and since then they dramatically expanded their cable distribution, which is great for them. They did a deal with Amazon. They were about to do a deal with Hulu when our deal was coming up for renewal. So what we said was that if we were going to do a non-exclusive deal for Epix, that would put the content on Netflix several months after pay television and they are completely non-exclusive. It wasn't a very strategic investment and therefore it would be very small relative to what we had been paying. And so we agreed that were -- our strategic initiative and theirs were diverging, and we just went our separate ways. We do a great deal of business with Lions Gate. We're continuing to expand our business Paramount and MGM around the world, so this isn't a studio problem, it's just really was the Epix product was less and less in tune with what we're doing at Netflix around exclusivity and windows acceleration.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: And while the movies on Epix are quite good, we found that there is more awareness on the original side and what we're hoping for over this next two year as we launch, so really incredible movies that are highly original and premier on Netflix as well as in the movie theater simultaneously that we can do better putting the money into those kind of spectacles that we create more consumer desire and awareness through that vehicle than through this additional pay-one licensing.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: And I think that some of the economics match the success of original program, original series programming, which is for the cost of production. You have full exclusivity and global rights in perpetuity versus a very narrow window a year after it's released in the theater in one territory. So a $1 billion of output spending versus a $1 billion in for original spending and they turn out to the right strategy.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: And then, a follow-up question on the price increase. So this is the second dollar price increase, I think, in about a 15 month, 18 month timeframe. How do you think about pricing going forwards? Is this now the Netflix norm about once a year $1 price increase? I think long-term you believe you've got a lot of ARPU power. Is there any change in thinking about whether that's due to tiering as opposed to just straight up price increases?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: So Mark, Netflix is $7.99 for our standard -def offering. It was $7.99 last year, it was $7.99 two years ago, three years ago, so yes it is due to the tiering. And what we're trying to do is spread out the tiers, so that now we've got the $7.99 standard-def, but $9.99 high-definition, and $11.99 ultra-high definition. So think of it is related to putting in a good tiering mechanism as opposed to anything else, and really Netflix is highly available. And standard-def is DVD quality, its not bad quality at all. So that $7.99 for DVD quality, unlimited streaming video, it's an incredible value.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: So a follow-up on that, does that mean that we should expect those three price points to stay the same for the next three to five years. Do you have the tiering that you want right now?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: We're not making any prognostications about the future on the pricing, but it is related to the value. And the more that we have incredible value, the more that we have amazing originals, then over time we're going to be able to ask consumers for more to be able to invest more. And that's been the rhythm we've been on as we did the tearing and introduced that, if you look at how much broader and bigger our content is now than two years ago, I think we fairly delivered on that promise.\n",
      "David Hyman: And I think, it's worth saying that consumers have acknowledged that I think, that with the combination of grandfathering and the content additions that we've been able to make in the terms of the reactions, I think people are acknowledging that there is real value being delivered through the service.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: On the original content side, for a couple of years you guys have been making your own shows and you've never acknowledged that any show was less than successful. You never had to take a write-down. As you start spending more on original content and as you make bigger individual bets on things like movies, at what point do you think you will be able to tell or investor should be able to expect to hear from your performance of individual shows, movies or any other kind of content that -- ?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: So Peter, you should keep in mind, that as our slate of original programming grows, the diversity, the size, the scope, the scale of those shows is different. So when we say a show is successful, it's because relative to the investment it's successful, relative to how else we would have spent that money on licensing something else, does this creation, did it attract the audience that it was built for. So the range of budgets is very broad. The range of audiences we expect to bring to it are very broad. So that's why we've been right in so far in terms of predicting the size of the audience for these shows. Not that they don't all reach 30 million subscribers.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: You haven't made any mistakes in your projections and your original content to date for the last two years.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Well, we've not had content write-down, so to your point. So basically we're saying is that we're investing according to the size of the show. And when we've been wrong, there's been more upside than we had forecasted. So we had got into our original programming, very conservative in terms of our modeling, relative to licensing, and have found that it's been much more impactful.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: Peter, probably the best way to externally tell, is do we take on additional seasons of a show. So some shows have been so successful that we're moving on to season fours. One show had a lot of growth, it was great for what it was. The season three was the final season. And so you can say, well, therefore that was less successful, and that's true. But so far, we haven't had any show that's performed so weakly in season one that we haven't taken it to season two. I'm sure there will be such a show eventually, but that's probably the best indicator that you or an investor could use, and it didn't really work for us. Yes, we didn't do more of it.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: And in that case you'd say it was relative to an eight season show, it was less successful, but in its own economics were was quite successful.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: Yes. Go ahead.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: Recently Amazon just moved to block the sales of Apple and Google streaming devices with their competitive products. Given your dependence on Amazon's AWS, are you rethinking that relationship? Can you rethink that relationship?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: AWS has been a great supplier to us. They demonstrated again and again strong market leadership, strong attentiveness to our account. We could not be happier with AWS. And they've always kept that separate from Amazon retail. So with Amazon retail, we've had up and down issues for a couple of years, we couldn't buy ads on IMDB, things like that, and that never spilled over to AWS. Now, we have a really good relationship with Amazon retail also. But the important point to your question is they manage those separately, and we're very committed to AWS and are comfortable with that commitment.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: Let me switchback over to international markets. I think the overall sub numbers came in higher than expected and the guidance was a little bit higher than the Street at least expected. But the mix of free subs was a little bit higher than I think most people had expected. Do you have a decent read as to whether those free subs are converting like you've seen in other markets, any particular reason that there is extra risk here, because those subs may not convert as well?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: No, you should see those consistent.\n",
      "David Wells: Yes, there is no change in trend there, Mark.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: And then in a fourth quarter, I think your international revenue forecast implies like a trailing off in ARPU or pretty sharp sequential drop in ARPU, is there a particular reason behind that? Are you at specific price points in some of the newer markets that you're launching?\n",
      "David Wells: No. It's the strong dollar, Mark. So there is a bit of a headwind there because of the strong dollar.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: On the content side, HBO one of your big competitor is moving into news. A lot of that supposedly aimed at millennials, theoretically your customers as well. Is that something you guys would contemplate at all? And then some more question for sports. You guys have repeatedly said you're not interested in sports. Are you willing to serve conceded that maybe you would be a little interested at some point down the road?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Well, look on the news side, I think we definitely are being more adventurous in terms of the genres that we're going into. We're getting ready to launch Chelsea Handler's talk show early next year, that's our first move into talk. Kind of aimed at the same kind of thing, we have a weekly talk show, where most of our things have been very long shelf-like movies and television series. So I think it's a very kind of similar migration or certainly exploration. And in sports, I think we're in the same place. There is a lot of irrational bidders for sports. We're not anxious to become another one.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: So to translate that sounds like you're saying you're not likely to move into sports, but news you're already interested in and may increase that appetite.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Yes, we're interested in being able to improve the viewing experience whatever kind of content people are watching. So I think in sports, sports on-demand is not as exciting as sports live, where I think everything else that we're doing that kind of freeze the viewers from the linear schedule in ways that they enjoy and more enjoy the programming, then we could bring some value to that.\n",
      "David Wells: So Ted you're leaving the lead there for innovation, right. You're giving yourself a little bit room for innovating.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Yes, exactly.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: Well, let's be clear on that room. What's the likelihood that we compete directly with VICE in the next two years?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Probably high.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: There you go.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: All, Amazon, Roku, Google, I'm missing somebody, Apple, all introduced new streaming boxes in last few weeks. Are you seeing more usages and more growth from sort of dumb TVs with smart boxes or you're seeing more usage and growth from connect TVs that have the stuff baked in?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: They're both growing. They compete with each other. So those categories are growing. It's only really the game consoles that are not growing as fast for secular reasons, the early on. They were the only high-connected devices attached to the TV. And now, they are facing competition in share from smart TVs and from these attached devices.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: David, a balance sheet question for you. I think in the letter, you talk about looking to raise additional capital next year. Do you think the next year will be the last year in which you'll need to do that, as you think about the plans for the next three to five years? And then any additional color on what kind of capital or how you would raise that capital next year?\n",
      "David Wells: Well, it's largely unknown, right. I mean you're asking me three or four years out. But I would say, given our plans to expand content and given the fact that we're on pace to use about $1 billion this year and no indications that that would shrink next year, we wanted to give some headway or some inside into the fact that we may be back in the market next year. We've done that on a regular sort of cadence of about once a year. So there is no change from that. But there is still some uncertainty in terms of the pipeline, how much we would need exactly next year. But I would say, safe indications are that we will be back in the market in the next 12 to 18 months.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: And then a success scenario, where Ted is able to invest the originals as well in the future as he has in the past. We would hope to be back, because we want to be funding these incredible creative productions around the world. So in a success scenario, we would do a bunch more over the next five, 10 years.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: And in terms of contribution margins maybe again David for you, I think you reiterated your goal of getting to 40% contribution margins in U.S. by 2020. Are those European countries and some of that in Canada, some of that earlier countries that you launched in. Could you just talk about what the contribution margin has been like in those markets? Has it been similar to what you did in the U.S. over the last three years?\n",
      "David Wells: Well, similar to the comment of Reed, we don't give a specific, Mark, in commentary for competitive reasons. But we have said and I'll reiterate that there is nothing structural that means we can't get equal or better margins outside the U.S. that we've seen in the U.S. And we gave you a data point on Canada that that had reached U.S. margin. About 18 months ago, we gave you a point on that. So there is no reason that we couldn't do better. Largely it's determined competitively within that country or that region in terms of how well we do on the profit side.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: Recently you guys agreed to sell subscriptions to Apple phone users via iOS in app purchases. For years you didn't do that. Are you paying the same 30% tax that everyone else pays, when someone gets an app subscription through Apple? And then why make that change now after years of not doing that?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: It's a great opportunity to expand. So historically, we've only been on the Apple TV and that on the iPhone. And we don't comment specifically on the business terms. So I can't directly answer your question. But we're really excited about the potential, especially as we go global over the next year-and-a-half to be able to serve all of the iPhone customers around the world. So some higher motivation on our side to get access to that incredible iPhone customer base around the world.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: If that does generate a lot of new subscriptions, will we see the impact of that on you financials? Will those come in significantly lower monthly revenue numbers?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: No, the revenue is the same. You would see an increase in COGS to deal with the fees to Apple. That's where it would show up. But it's essentially the gross revenue the 7.99 or 9.99 that shows for us.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: Curious what you guys think of new streaming offerings from Verizon and Comcast both, what you think of them as actual content? And what you think of the notion and broadband providers that you need to work with, now competing with subscription or streaming services?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: We're really big and everybody has got to get into streaming. It's been our main message for several years, that what is known as channels is going to become apps. And that all of these providers need to have great apps on a phone, on a tablet, on a TV, so it's completely consistent with all of that. And what we see is if we have great content, then consumers watch our service and enjoy it and tell their friends about it. And it kind of doesn't matter that there is also a great sports game on or there is also a shows on Verizon or on Comcast. So part of the reason that we may seem a little blasÃ© is that it really hasn't affected us. What has affected us is when we have great show like Narcos that just takes the world by storm. So that's what we're focused on, how do we have more incredible shows.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: Do you think that the products of Verizon and Comcast just launched are great products?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: It's early in the market. They are great companies. They will work on that. But I'm not going to critique them. They're all, they are in, they are trying, and that's a great thing. Of course, you seen Sony Vue, you've seen the Dish sling product. So people are really innovative, which is great for consumers. And not every product, when it first comes out is great, and they'll continue to work on them.\n",
      "David Wells: And there are certainly better iterations than their prior versions. So they are getting better.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Our first streaming offering was pretty ugly.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: Ted, we got a couple of series of emails about whether Star Wars is going to be available, all the films on the Netflix next year, what's the answer?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: They're all subject to negotiations. It's up to Disney, how they want to manage access to those assets before, during or after the release of Star Wars 7. So it's certainly an ongoing discussion.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: And assuming Star Wars launches theatrically this year, then it would not come to Netflix as part of the [multiple speakers].\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: No, it would be the last title on the Starz, in the Disney output going to Starz.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: So it wouldn't come to Netflix.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Yes, correct.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: And then there was a new user interface launched on the site about four months ago, and hoped that that would be kind of improved user retention satisfaction levels four months in, any takeaways?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: Super happy with it, and we're generating new improvements already, improvements there, improvements on mobile, improvements on the TV. So thinking a product group is just an amazing learning organization. It's always pushing the balance and its steady improvement on all of those fronts, Mark. And it's the aggregate of that, which has us at so many viewing hours and so much customer satisfaction that we've been working at all of these improvements over the last seven years on streaming.\n",
      "David Wells: And that's been very flattered in terms of being imitated across the world.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: You guys changed your amortization schedule for your license content, just like you had for originals, you said it's because you're seeing more viewing in the first month. What does that mean are people -- does that mean people are less interested in the stuff than you thought overtime or they're more interested than you thought. Originally what does that tell us about viewing behavior?\n",
      "David Wells: Presumably, Peter you're referring to that amortization change or the change in accounting estimate. And no, it doesn't. You can't conclude that nor should you conclude that from the change. What we're saying is there is more viewing in the first month not necessarily less viewing over the lifetime, it just moved up a little bit. And it could be that we view that at so much good content over the last few years that it's become -- you have to make a good choice, right. You've got 20 good choices, you're choosing. So it could be that the merchandising system is concentrating a little bit of that when something comes in. Regardless, we try to be accurate in our accounting, and we follow the trends regularly on a quarterly basis. And this past quarter, we noted some content that was trending up, so we accelerated the amortization on that. We wanted to be upfront, even though it's relatively small based, if you look at it in comparison to the overall U.S. content spend it's relatively small.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: Peter, let me give you a little example, it will help on this one. Suppose we pay $1 million dollars for a title for a four year license, and we think it's going to go 1 million hours of viewing. But the title is just incredibly popular, and instead it does 10 million hours. But many of those hours are in the first month as supposed to spread over the four years. Well, then we would accelerate the amortization of that million dollars, even though the whole thing is doing much better than we ever thought. Its relative proportion overtime is more upfront. So that's why we would front load that million dollars.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: And generally what's happening, are these things over performing or is there a mix where they sometimes are performing less well than you thought?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: It's not about the total performance that gets us to change the amortization, it's the relative performance overtime. And so if it performs a lot in the beginning, relative to how it does at the end. That's what gets us to accelerate. So your earlier question about write-downs is what's missing. You're not quite getting that, let's see, if a title under performed our estimate, but was very back-loaded, then the right accounting would be to shift it out further as oppose to pull it up. And so you're thinking of it in a write-up and write-down sense, and that's not actually how it works. The schedule is based upon how it does overtime relative to the license period. Did that example help?\n",
      "Peter Kafka: No, no, but in both cases you're saying look, we have these things for so long that it always worked out. That is why I was asking about the write-down part. You've never once reached a point where you missed entirely and you found something that no one wants over any more time.\n",
      "David Wells: Let me take that, Peter, because I think there has been a couple of questions on that. We certainly license things that perform less well than we expected sometimes, right. There is a portfolio of content that we're licensing. We don't always get it right. But in the case if something that doesn't perform as well as we expected, we're not a producer that has ultimate revenues like a production studio that has to write that down based on a lower expectation of revenue. We have something available on our service in broadcaster accounting. And in broadcasters, if we're deriving revenue over the life of that license period over the service, it doesn't result in a write-down. It just maybe an opportunity cost that we can license something better down the road.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Well, and a good recent real world example is Longmire. We just released the original fourth season of Longmire. So season one, two, and three, which we've licensed for several years on Netflix, they were at the kind of tail end of their life, actually exploded when Longmire season four launched. So it's very unique to the behavior, like nothing actually performs like everything else. So we are trying to do is make sure the amort matches the viewing patterns.\n",
      "David Wells: And it's a good lead in to remind everyone that these are dynamic, right. That's why we look at it every quarter, because things change. We see when something gets released like Longmire or we release the third season, then the first season of that particular title may see a bump. So it's something that we're constantly looking at.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: And where it's ambiguous, we would tend to want to amortize it more quickly. That's advantages to us.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Right.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: But it has to be justified by the actual viewing patterns.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: On global rights deals, Ted, just a big picture, as you see yourself, is the company able to negotiate more and more of these content deals on a global rights basis?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Yes, it's definitely been the drive of myself and my team all year, trying to move the sellers into a more of a global mode. Remember, they are mostly situated as regional sellers of content, sometimes the rights are fragmented in their ownership. But in the cases of the deals we did this past quarter, they were controlled by one entity and typically solved by multiple regions and we corralled the deals into the corporate offices, and were able to license the world on those titles. Titles that we think will have great global appeal. So I think the growth, the opportunities, the challenges of Netflix are all global, so that its having a lot of regional discussions around the world isn't that efficient. And it turns out that tastes are rather global too. So it's actually really well lined up.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: And then Ted or Reed, when you think about the mix in international markets of local versus global content, any general change in your thinking on what the optimum mix is, and you find it that you're constantly toggling with depending on the market that you're in?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: It's interesting, like you said every time we launch in a new market, we know more in that first 24 hours of viewing, than we did from a year of research. And in terms of the move, I think, we went in expecting Japan to be much more local than it turned out to be. It's more local than other territories, but not as local as conventional wisdom would have had. And it actually moves with a global desire for some of these large shows, so that the local tastes are usually determined by what you have access to. And if we're growing the access to great content around the world, people are moving or migrating to that kind of viewing. So that's why we're able to do local language originals, our own global originals and then licensed content, not just from Hollywood to the world, but from the world to the rest of the world.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: Another international question. Can you guys give us any update on China, either in terms of what you're thinking about in terms of timing or what your approach is going to be to a really regulated market there when you do show up?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: We can tell you, well, we're still learning a lot. So nothing really specific our helpful, except that we're still in early stages.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: And lot of you guys mentioned getting in new Pay TV Window for a specific movie, The Big Short. Are you negotiating those deals now on one-off deals for individual movies or you're doing these for whole slates?\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: There were conversations directly with producers. So a lot of times, well, if you can get to the rights before they get fragmented, that's when you could do those deals. So they tend to be more curated title-by-title in that way.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: Reed, I think I'll just ask one last question directly to you. When you think about the biggest challenges that you think Netflix faces over the next several years, three to five years, what do you think they are? What do you focus most of your time on?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: Well, I would say the biggest challenge is, our being the service that people want, really feeling out more movies and more TV shows. We're working so hard to have these great original productions, and if we could have 10 more Oranges and 5 more Narcos, I know I'm putting a lot of pressure, that would be really transformative. Especially, I'll bring up the Narcos, we've got an example, because it was filmed in Bogota, Columbia. The main company doing it, it was a French company. So it's a very international production; Brazilian cast. And we have an incredible production Marseille, which I'll give a little plug for, that's in filming now. And I think it will be a really great crossover around the world kind of crime, drama, family, politics. And the more we do these around the world, obviously, that's great in a local market in terms of establishing our bona fides and reputation with customers. But it's also great, because there is something new, something fresh. And as long as we're continuing to push the bounds on things, like original movies or international productions, then the consumers are really embracing.\n",
      "Mark Mahaney: David, help us think through and it's I guess one of same things I am sensing very strongly is just increasing appetite enthusiasm for original content. From a P&L perspective, that $5 billion next year in content spend, theoretically if that was 25% original content versus 15% or 10%, the impact of that on margins, as you mix shift more and more towards original content, is that accretive to margins?\n",
      "David Wells: Well, the good news for me as a forecaster is it does take Ted a little bit of time to actually produce these shows. So anyway, we get a little bit of lead time in terms of some visibility into the production. So our targets at 40% U.S. margin already encapsulate this shift towards originals overtime. I think we made some earlier comments about a long-term shift that could be upwards of 50% of originals, and we still anticipate being able to meet our margin targets and also shift towards originals. It's going to bring more amortization in, but we think we can do both.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: And I'll use the word expansion. So think of it as our license content is growing, but our original content is growing faster. There is a mix shift, but I don't want that to get misunderstood as a reduction in license spending.\n",
      "David Wells: We are still spending on licensed content.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: And remember, between original films, original cartoons, animated shows for kids, our original scripted series, we're releasing more original titles in Q4 than we released in entire second year of original programming. So it is accelerating rather quickly and you're seeing it.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: Reed, you said for a while now, the future of TV is apps, and now Tim Cook is saying the same thing, it's now the conventional wisdom. Do you think individual viewers or consumers want to pick and choose their own apps, their own shows, serving in a la carte world or do you think there's a role for someone who sort of bundle all the stuff back together.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: Well, that will be a really interesting question over the next couple of years. We're going to work really hard to expand our movies and TV shows so quickly in such a compelling way, that lots of the viewing for movies and TV shows is through Netflix, which is sort of what makes us want to focus so much on that area. But I could imagine future bundles emerging. Once there is a whole bunch of apps, and as you go through this industry change now, next probably three, five, 10 years, where there is a lot of discrete offerings, everybody is improving their brand value. And then you get to a maturing phase of the market, and then there is some consolidation, which could be acquisitions, it could be other things or it could be bundles. But the next couple years, when you have this new phase of the market, I think everyone is just racing to make a great app like Netflix, like HBO Now, those things. We should hit your last question here, because we're running out of time.\n",
      "Peter Kafka: This will be it. It's a small one. You're seeing some folks sort of rebundle already, right. Hulu is showing Showtime together. Would you be comfortable having Netflix bundle with another service?\n",
      "Reed Hastings: We don't see a lot of take rate from our consumer side on the Hulu Showtime. We think we're better focused on just establishing the Netflix brand. Again, at this phase in the market, we think the real key is focus. At some future time the bundling may be appropriate. Of course, we'll keep an eye and watch the Hulu Showtime take rate to see, to confirm that there is very little traction of that. So we'll be open minded. But our instinct is focused on making Netflix the passion brand in this space. End of Q&A\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: And before we sign off, we should remind everybody that Friday, tomorrow, is the premier of Beasts of No Nation on Netflix and in selected theaters around the country.\n",
      "Reed Hastings: Awesome movie. I hope you guys all watch. Thank you guys.\n",
      "David Wells: Thank you.\n",
      "Theodore Sarandos: Thank you.\n"

With that, let me turn the call over to you, Howard.\n",
      "Howard Schultz: Thank you, JoAnn, and good afternoon to everyone on todayâ€™s call. Before we begin, as a lifelong New Yorker, Iâ€™d like to express my heartfelt concern for the many millions of people impacted by this weekâ€™s devastating hurricane. The images we have seen and stories we have heard are beyond heartbreaking. All of us at Starbucks are grateful to the thousands of first responders who are courageously and selflessly responding to this disaster, and our thoughts go out to those directly affected. I will now turn to the record fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 financial results Starbucks reported today. Q4 was an extraordinary quarter for Starbucks on almost every level. Record fourth quarter revenue of $3.4 billion, strong fourth quarter EPS of $0.46 which includes charges of $0.02 per share related to our store portfolio optimization initiatives in Europe, an increase in our total company operating margin to 15.4% and significant relevant innovation across our business segments and around the world. Starbucks solid Q4 performance has ideally positioned us to go into holiday with strong momentum supporting a powerful lineup of holiday beverages and product offerings and to further our commitment to continue growing sales and delivering increased profits to our shareholders in 2013 and in the future. Q4 also caps off a record full year in which our sales rose 14% to a record $13.3 billion, and our earnings rose 18% to a record $1.79 per share. What makes our performance during the quarter and the year even more remarkable is that both were achieved in the face of profound, continued economic uncertainty and challenged consumer environments in markets all around the world in which we operate and compete. Starbucks ability to deliver the results we did in Q4 and 2012 is a reflection of the strength of our business and brand, our deep connection to our growing universe of global customers and the correctness of our go-to-market strategies. As we were all reminded at our Leadership Conference last month in Houston, the key to our success are the 200,000 Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron and deliver the Starbucks experience to our customers every day. To each of my partners, I want to say that I am humbled by your dedication and commitment, and that you have my deep personal gratitude and appreciation for all that you do. In fiscal 2012, Starbucks served nearly 3 billion customers who visited our stores, a statistic that testifies to the reach and breadth of our increasingly global brand and local relevance. And while the 18,000 stores in 61 countries we have today may sound like a large number, the fact is that the opportunity of Starbucks to grow our business around the world in a profitable, disciplined and deliberate fashion has never been greater or more exciting. Over the past 12 months, we added over 1,000 net new stores with two-thirds of those being outside the U.S. and we remodeled more than 2,000 stores globally. Our plans call for us to open an additional 1300 net new stores and to remodel roughly 2,000 more in fiscal 2013. We are well on our way to having more than 20,000 Starbucks stores on six continents by 2014. After more than 40 years Starbucks worldwide appeal remains undeniable. Starbucks is seeing strong and sustained growth in our core retail business across both the Americas, and China and Asia-Pacific regions where comp store sales growth reached 7% and 10% respectively. Iâ€™d like to personally recognize Cliff Burrows, President of our Americas segment and John Culver, President of China, Asia-Pacific for their leadership in delivering the tremendous results they did in Q4. Particularly noteworthy is that Starbucks U.S. business revenue grew 9% and U.S. comps grew 7% in Q4. Reflecting a level of execution and intensity that is nothing short of fantastic given the softer than expected performance we saw in Q3. We accomplished our U.S. results by taking swift and decisive action to drive increased store traffic and improve operating efficiency, at the very first sign of the early summer slowing in traffic that we and many other retailers began to experience. And we continue to drive traffic in August by re-launching our popular and successful (inaudible) campaign and participating in a record-breaking, LivingSocial offer that was taken up by 1.5 million Starbucks customers, in believe it or not, in less than 24 hours. These initiatives also enabled us to generate incremental profitable sales, further communicate Starbucksâ€™ powerful value proposition and attract more customers to our U.S. stores for the September rollout of our full beverage lineup than ever before. As I mentioned earlier, the strong momentum we saw in Q4 has ideally positioned us as we head into Q1 of 2013 and the holiday season. Our traditional red cups and holiday beverages are beginning to appear in stores as a prelude to the official kickoff of holiday of our U.S. stores on November 13th. And I can tell you that we have the strongest and most exciting lineup of handcrafted holiday beverages and limited edition products in store for our customers than ever before. Also new this year, is Starbucks Christmas Blend Blonde Roast, a specially selected blend of Latin American and aged Sumatra beans that delivers a noticeably light and cheerful note. Christmas Blend Blonde Roast is a perfect complement to our fall â€“ to our full lineup of holiday season offerings that extends both our Blonde Roast offerings and our best-selling Christmas Blend portfolio. But the big news for Starbucks this holiday season is the innovation and opportunity we have unleashed with Verismo. The only single-serve beverage system that delivers perfectly crafted Starbucks CaffÃ¨ Lattes and espresso beverages as well as brewed coffee from a single machine. If you havenâ€™t tried Verismo yet, I urge you to. The Verismo system produces the highest quality, best tasting, in-home, single-serve espresso and coffee beverages anywhere, bar none. And itâ€™s the first and only single-serve machine that uses pods made from real milk to deliver beverage quality and versatility meeting Starbucks exacting standards. In the eight months since we announced the Verismo system, we have successfully planned and executed the launch of Verismo in 6400 retail locations including premier specialty retailers like Williams-Sonoma in the U.S. where Verismo was chosen to be showcased on the cover of its holiday catalog. Harrods in the U.K., in Starbucks stores across the U.S. and Canada and through online e-commerce channels in 3 other countries. We are supporting Verismo with only the third national TV campaign in our 41-year history, elegantly through the unique Starbucks lens and in a way that introduces and celebrates Verismo system and elevates the Starbucks brand. With more than 10,000 Verismo demonstrations and sampling events taking place over the next several weeks, we expect Verismoâ€™s momentum to accelerate through the holiday season and continue into the feature. In addition to launching Verismo, our Channel Development team has continued to innovate in the premium single-serve category with other new product introductions across the portfolio, including Blonde Roast and our new successful Refreshers platform. As a result of these and other initiatives, our Channel Development business increased revenues by 50% in fiscal 2012 to $1.3 billion. We have expanded our global Channel Development presence now to 20 countries and we are targeting tens of thousands of new points of distribution, but I can assure you Jeff Hansberry and his team are just getting started. This month marks the first anniversary of the Starbucks K-Cup launch. And Iâ€™m very pleased to report that in fiscal 2012, less than a full year of operation, we shipped nearly 500 million Starbucks K-Cups and have garnered a full 15.6% share of the premium single cup market, well above what people expected. VIA also continued to grow sales in fiscal 2012. VIA is now available in 14 countries and 80,000 points of global distribution. It grew nearly 50% in FY12 and garnered a 7% share of the premium single cup category in U.S. grocery channels in Q4. Together, our complimentary and carefully planned and executed K-Cup, VIA and Verismo product and go-to-market strategies provide Starbucks with the strongest and most complete comprehensive lineup of products and the definitive winning hand in the premium single cup category, and there will be more innovation to come. In 2012, we made significant headway against our ongoing plans to elevate and transform our food platform and bring authentic and delicious food to customers through the acquisition of La Boulange bakery. The fresh bakery products we are developing with the artists and bakers at La Boulange will rank among the very best bakery products you have ever tasted. Weâ€™ve been testing new La Boulange offerings to a fantastic customer response and significant sales lift and now plan to rollout La Boulange products in 2,500 company-operated Starbucks stores across the U.S. beginning in the spring of 2013. Evolution Fresh, another of our emerging brands is also helping to expand and enhance our retail store and Channel Development operation and processes. Last month, we opened an Evolution Fresh store in San Franciscoâ€™s Fillmore district our third Evolution Fresh location in the first one outside of Greater Seattle. Our fourth location will be opening in Seattleâ€™s University Village shopping center later this month. At the same time our Channel Development segment is continuing to significantly expand the availability of bottled Evolution Fresh juices through premium grocery channels in Starbucks stores. Evolution Fresh bottled juices are now available over 1,500 grocery locations including Whole Foods and Safeway and approximately 2,200 West Coast Starbucks stores, where we have seen a 100% lift over the juice product get replaced in our stores and we are on track to continue extending distribution of Evolution Fresh into more of our major U.S. company-operated markets throughout fiscal 2013. And Starbucks is making a big difference in the business in just a short time we have owned the company. Sales of Evolution Fresh bottled juice, through all channels in the latest quarter, were up 50% over sales in the same period of 2011 prior to our acquisition of the company. Our intention is to create another dynamic national brand with Evolution Fresh. And to meet the anticipated demand for Evolution Fresh products, we are adding a state-of-the-art juicery in Southern California in late 2013 that will have four to five times the production and packaging capability of the current Evolution Fresh facility. As I have noted in the past, Starbucks is embracing the seismic shifts in consumer behavior that are well underway. Let me now take a moment to share our progress and the investments weâ€™re making to continue our leadership in card, loyalty, social, digital and now mobile commerce, all of which will significantly enhance our customers experience with Starbucks. Our card and loyalty initiatives are continuing to drive great convenience and value for many customers. This has been a record year with nearly $3 billion loaded onto Starbucks Cards, with Starbucks Card transactions accounting for over 25% of U.S. store tender. The My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program has already amassed more than 10 million members, half of whom are active participants and have opted in to receive communications from us. As many of you know, we recently unveiled a number of enhancements to our loyalty program in the U.S. and Canada, including making rewards fully digital, making it easier for customers to earn free rewards, and including free food as part of the rewards option. As a result, we are already seeing record numbers of membership signups in the first few weeks of our new fiscal year, which really will bode well for fiscal and calendar 2013. The depth and breadth of our digital assets continues to grow with leadership positions and engagement across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and many other relevant medium. All this progress will now become even more relevant given the sea change in behavior and experience enabled by the ubiquity and personalization of mobile technologies. Our mobile payment platform has become the leading number one program for any consumer brand or retailer in North America, with now more than 2 million mobile payment transactions occurring every week and more than 100 million mobile payment transactions logged since the launch of Starbucks mobile payment app in January of last year. We believe the rapid adoption of mobile gives us an opportunity to create a unique and much deeper relationship with our customers directly and in the moment like no other consumer brand or retailer. We have the unprecedented ability to reach new customers, create awareness to new products, drive incremental transactions and explore new revenue streams in music and digital publishing. Recently, we have evaluated dozens of mobile payment solutions in companies, with an eye towards trying to find a company with a similar vision and approach to creating a mobile payment platform, where the customer experience is paramount. And that led us to Jack Dorsey and his team at Square. By partnering with Square and accepting their innovative Square Wallet mobile payment app in our stores, we are able to not only offer a complimentary mobile payment solution to our apps but we are also able to reduce our interchange fees for U.S. debit and credit card processing. Weâ€™re looking forward to Starbucks customers being to use able the Square Wallet app to pay for purchases with their mobile phones in U.S. â€“ in U.S. stores later this month. While we are proud of what we accomplished thus far in mobile, we plan to continue to push the envelope in the future by adding features and interactive activity in such areas as tipping, mobile ordering and personalization. And I can assure you, the best is yet to come in terms of the innovation that we are going to bring to the marketplace that creates separation, not only between us and other people in our space, but us and every other consumer and retail business. While I touched on the enormity of the global expansion opportunity for Starbucks that lies ahead, I would like to take a few moments to update you on a few of our recent global initiatives. Two weeks ago, I was in India to participate in the extraordinary opening of our flagship store in bustling Horniman Circle area of Mumbai. Our Horniman Circle store, without question, the most elegant Starbucks store we have created anywhere in the world, is a stunning two level experience that celebrates sensibility and respect to the beautiful tapestry of Indiaâ€™s culture, while at the same time embracing Starbucks unique coffee heritage. In the days following the opening of the Horniman Circle store, we opened our second and third store in Mumbai. All three stores are exceeding our loftiest expectations. I cannot be more proud to enter the Indian market with the Tata Group, a global organization that shares many of the same values that Starbucks was founded on over 40 years ago. Starbucks opportunity in India is tremendous, and Iâ€™m confident that India will evolve into one of Starbuckâ€™s five largest markets over time. We also continue to deepen our connection to consumers in China, where recently alongside Apple and Nike, Starbucks was named one of Chinaâ€™s top 10 foreign brands. And just last week Starbucks received best employer in China recognition. These acknowledgements are testament to the dedication of our 15,000 Starbucks partners in China who deliver the Starbucks experience to the millions of customers visiting our 700 stores in Mainland China each week. Now despite recent economic reports pointing to a slowdown in China, it remains for us, one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the world, with rapidly increasing spending power of the fast-growing middleclass, and a market that continues to represent a major significant future retail growth opportunity for us. And Starbucks business remains extremely strong in China as evidenced by a 52% year-over-year increase in sales and double digit comps in China. Weâ€™re building the China market deliberately and in a brand accretive way by making significant investments in our people, our systems and our operations. And the connection our partners are building with our customers in China gives me great confidence that we can ultimately bring the Starbucks experience to tens of millions of consumers through thousands of stores across the Mainland. In that regard I am pleased to report that we are on track to reach our near-term goal of having 1,500 stores in China by 2015, and that China will soon be our largest market outside of the U.S. Our journey across the China and Asia-Pacific regions continues as we look forward to opening our first store in Vietnam in early 2013. Finally, I recently attended the 10th anniversary celebration of Starbucks entry into Mexico meeting with inspiring partners and taking part in the opening of the marketâ€™s first lead store. With 350 stores in Mexico, it is Starbucks third largest market within the Americas region. Mexico is also a fast growing market in Latin America. Together with our JV partner Alsea, we plan to open 150 net new stores in Mexico over the next three years. Before I introduce Michelle Gass, President of Starbucks EMEA, to share some of the developments and Iâ€™m happy to say progress we are making in Europe and in the U.K., I want to tell you about the most important investment we will make all year in investment in our people. Last month 10,000 Starbucks partners gathered in Houston, Texas for our Leadership Conference. Just as with our transformational conference we held in New Orleans in 2008, Houston provided an extraordinary and inspiring three-day opportunity for us to connect our leaders to the heart of our company, enhance and refine their coffee expertise, inspire leadership skills and perfect the art exceeding customer expectations. The power and impact of the three days we spent together in Houston will reverberate throughout Starbucks this year and beyond, and enable us take our record breaking fourth quarter and 2012 performance to a completely new level in the future. Itâ€™s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michelle Gass.\n",
      "Michelle Gass: Thank you Howard and good afternoon everyone. Iâ€™m delighted to be with you on the call today to update you on our EMEA business and the progress over the last year as our three-region operating model has taken hold. And as the EMEA leadership team and I have embarked on our transformation strategy or as we call it our renaissance plan. The region today operates across 36 countries in nearly 1,900 stores. Over the last year, weâ€™ve opened 111 net new stores including 10 company-owned and 101 licensed. Weâ€™ve grown our geographic reach most notably with our recently announced partnership in Scandinavia with Umoe Group. We will open our first stores in the early part of 2013 in both Oslo and Stockholm with this terrific new partner. As you know, the EMEA region historically operates at significantly lower margins than the Americas and China, Asia-Pacific regions. There are several reasons for this. In our company-owned markets of U.K., Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria, our portfolio is dominated by high street shopping areas with occupancy cost 2 to 2.5 times that of the average occupancy costs in the U.S. as a percent of sales. This portfolio is also not as broad as in other Starbucks regions, where highly productive drive-throughs, small footprint stores and a strong presence of captive audience, licensors also diversify the retail footprint. All of these factors, coupled with the fragile state of the European economy and one of the fiercest competitive environments in the world makes for a robust exciting challenge. But on a positive note, these issues are largely within our control and we are taking actions. In the last year we had focused on driving results against three key strategies which are laying the foundation for a long-term profitable growth; first, increasing the Starbucks brand presence, health and relevancy across the region; second, unlocking the profitability of the existing base through focusing on top line growth and on operating cost; and third, positioning the region for growth primarily through licensing opportunities. I have great confidence that the region will achieve meaningful revenue and profit growth over the next five years and will deliver against our goal of mid-teens margin over time. Let me recap how we performed in the fourth quarter and later I will add some colors to the actions we are taking and the progress we are seeing. In Q4, revenues declined 2% versus the prior year driven by unfavorable currency exchange, but partially offset by 29% growth in revenue from licensed stores. Same-store sales were down 1% for the quarter driven largely by continued softness in Germany. And even though, the U.K. market delivered a slightly positive same-store increase for both the quarter and the year, this was dampened by continued weakness in consumer confidence and disappointing traffic levels experienced by most high street retailers throughout the London Olympics. Beyond our company-owned operations, our JV licensed business has shown continued strength with the Middle East, Turkey and Russia driving strong comp growth during the quarter and throughout the balance of FY 2012. The more encouraging news for the quarter and for the year is the progress in operating income. While EMEA has had an operating loss of $6.5 million and negative operating margin of 2.3% for the quarter, it included $11.5 million of charges related to the optimization of our store portfolio and $9.2 million of asset impairments for underperforming stores in the U.K., Germany and France. Excluding these charges, operating margin improved over the same period last year, as well as the second and third quarters of this year. We achieved this improvement through the efforts we have made on labor management, G&A, waste and a broad emphasis on cost control across all aspects of the business. The European portfolio optimization work involved in a number of factions, each focused on improving profitability and strengthening our P&L. These actions included a thorough review of the U.K. store portfolio, which resulted in negotiated lease termination charges as well as the transfer of airport stores in the U.K. to one of our existing channel licensing partners SSP. As a result, operating margin contracted by 410 basis points. As I mentioned, we realized $9.2 million of asset impairments for underperforming stores in the U.K., Germany and France. These expenses are a part of our normal quarterly review of underperforming stores and are not included in the portfolio optimization charges. They are reported in store operating expenses in our EMEA P&L and equate to a negative 320 basis points of margin impact in Q4. In the fourth quarter, we also transferred ownership of 17 stores in Ireland to an existing licensed partner Entertainment Enterprises. Ireland has always been a small market for us and it made more sense to leverage a partner with the local knowledge and capability in that country to drive profitability and growth. This resulted in a $4.9 million charge, which shows up in the other income line of the consolidated P&L outside of EMEA results. Looking forward there may be additional charges in the coming quarters, though likely to a much lesser extent than the Q4 as we have a handful of leases in which weâ€™re in the process of negotiating lease terminations. We know this is the right course of action to take and will leave us with a healthier, stronger portfolio upon which to build. As I mentioned earlier, our blueprint for change the EMEA renaissance plan has incorporated many lessons from the successful U.S. transformation of 2008 and 2009, that I had the privilege to be part of, while applying the lens of unique business and consumer challenges of Europe. Weâ€™re leading the organization to deliver our goals, bring relevancy in margin expansion and unlocking the regionâ€™s growth potential through a disciplined set of actions addressing coffee expertise, our people, driving frequency and loyalty and boldly telling our story. Iâ€™ll share briefly with you some of the actions of the past 12 months, my first year leading the regional team. Coffee and people is at the core of our business and our brand and is a central long-term focus of this plan. Given how critical the role espresso plays in the lives of European consumers, we must deliver the best latte on the high street. In the last year we retrained all of our baristas, we introduced foam art and we made changes locally to respond to the needs of our customers, including changing the standard of our most popular drink in U.K. the Tall Latte to double the espresso. Response has been positive and we view this as a long-term investment to winning in the U.K. market. Equally, we have placed a significant focus on inspiring our people across the region and on shoring up the strength of the Starbucksâ€™ mission and culture. I have personally traveled now to more than two-thirds of the countries we operate in, conducting roundtables and open forums with our customers and our people, helping to shape our plans ahead. Driving our espresso focus through innovation, local relevancy and marketing will be the primary emphasis of the year ahead. We have also applied great focus to enhancing the customer relationship and building loyalty and frequency. The biggest move we made this year was introducing customersâ€™ names on cups, including Starbucksâ€™ style chalk name badges on our partners, enabling greater customer connections. We are also placing a great deal of emphasis on the customer environment marrying the latest design ethos of Starbucks with local edge. We renovated nearly 100 stores across the U.K. in-time for the Olympics. We opened now a globally acclaimed store in Amsterdam, two beautiful new stores in Madrid and Barcelona and are prepared to open an unbelievable flagship store in Kuwait with many more on the way. We are also addressing value in relative ways. We launched Starbucks Card and My Starbucks Rewards across most of our company-owned markets and some of our JV and licensed operations. We are implementing value offers in markets across the region and we are dramatically increasing our presence in social media to connect with our customers through these important channels. As I close out, I would be remiss not to acknowledge the recent media coverage surrounding our tax practices in the U.K. and across EMEA. For 14 years, Starbucks has been honored to serve our millions of customers across the region. We have never avoided paying taxes, and in fact adhere rigorously to the local accounting rules and tax laws everywhere we do business. And we have demonstrated our continued willingness to be open and transparent about our operations and their impact on taxable income. We look forward to continuing to clarify our position about our European tax position in the days and weeks to come. And Iâ€™m so proud of our partners and how they have responded to customers and worked with one another throughout this period. They allowed us to stay close to the needs and the voice of our customers and helped to ensure that this is simply a point in time along the way that wonâ€™t affect our momentum nor our progress towards the objectives within the renaissance plan. The work our partners are doing throughout the region, the passion they are bringing, the love they have for their customers and the Starbucks brand is at the core of the progress we are making. I have great confidence that, like the U.S. transformation, we are positioning this region for profitable long-term growth. Thank you. Now let me turn the call over to Troy.\n",
      "Troy Alstead: Thanks, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. As you heard from Howard and Michelle, we could not be more pleased with the trajectory of our business and the strong results we continue to deliver. 2012 was a record year for Starbucks producing new highs in revenues, earnings, operating margin and return on capital. The company is stronger financially today than at any time in our history. We have a healthier pipeline of profitable growth opportunities in front of us now than ever before and weâ€™re deeper in terms of talent and capabilities to pursue those opportunities than weâ€™ve ever been. I will review the fourth quarter performance of our three other segments and the consolidated results for both the quarter and the year. Then Iâ€™ll update you on our guidance for what we anticipate will be another strong year in fiscal 2013. In the Americas, the fourth quarter was an impressive demonstration of the capability of that team and of their focus and adaptability. Revenues grew 9% for the quarter to $2.5 billion with 7% comparable store sales growth. Especially noteworthy about this result is that it came on top of 10% comp growth last Q4, which was the best quarter we have had in more than five years. As we discussed on our last call, June and July were soft months in the U.S. Cliff Burrows and his team took quick action throughout the U.S. stores to turn the direction of our transaction growth. Our store partners continue to provide outstanding experiences to our customers every day. We reintroduced Treat Receipt in August and the annual fall favorite Pumpkin Spice in September. Weâ€™ve provided customers value through the LivingSocial offer and we provided customers another reason to visit their Starbucks store with the launch of Refreshers. The result was a strong recovery of U.S. comp growth in the quarter to 7% with 5 percentage points of transaction growth. Americas operating income for the fourth quarter grew to $536 million, nearly 21% above last Q4. Strong sales and a high level of operating efficiency again provided increased leverage as we expanded operating margin by an outstanding 210 basis points to 21.4%. Store operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues dropped 70 basis points to 37.4%. Our experienced team of store managers adjusted labor schedules for the volatility we saw in the early summer period, which led to the right levels of store partners at the right time to deliver an outstanding Starbucks experience. Cost of sales and occupancy as a percent of revenues dropped 90 basis points over last Q4, due in part to increased sales leverage on our largely fixed occupancy costs. Now, in the China and Asia Pacific region, significant revenue growth continues to drive high margin returns. Revenues of $198 million were 23% higher than last Q4, boosted by incremental revenues from the new stores that opened in fiscal 2012 along with comparable store sales growth of 10%. The 10% comp growth was broad-based as our four company-operated markets China, Thailand, Singapore, and Australia, all posted healthy increases. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth in CAP and while some are lower than the growth rate for the past several quarters weâ€™ve been expecting that the extremely high comp growth of recent quarters would moderate over time. However, even with this expected slight moderation of comp growth, our business model in China remains outstanding and our growth acceleration plans are on track. In addition to the strength of comp growth in the region, new store performance remained strong. The CAP team opened 132 net new stores in Q4, the most ever in a single quarter for this region. Many of these were in China where we ended the year at 700 total stores. But the absolute number of new stores is not our primary focus in CAP. We remain acutely focused on and encouraged by the performance of those new stores. Stores opened in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 are delivering first year sales of approximately three times their investment, that is significantly above our targeted sales to investment ratio and speaks both to the high quality real estate our teams are securing, as well as the premium store experience we are designing and building. A higher pace of growth needs upfront investment to support it. This includes initial rent as we prepare the stores for business, higher labor for the stores first 8 to 10 weeks to set operational standards and understand the cadence of transactions and other growth-related expenses. These expenses were the largest contributor to the 340 basis point reduction in CAP operating margin in Q4 to 32.9%. A shift on our store portfolio composition was another contributor to the margin decline. As we have discussed in the past, we expect that as we continue our very profitable and rapid growth in China, we will shift the mix of stores in the region from predominantly licensed today to somewhat less licensed in the future. That business makeshift will have the impact of moderately reducing CAP segment margins over time and the shift did impact margins in the fourth quarter. In Channel Development, we completed a very active year with a strong fourth quarter. Revenues of $319 million grew by $76 million over last Q4. This increase of 32% was driven largely by sales of Starbucks and Tazo K-Cups, which have gained nearly a full point of market share in food, drug and mass channels since June. Channel Development achieved its significant milestone in Q4 as quarterly operating income exceeded $100 million for the first time ever. This represents an increase of 26% over last yearâ€™s fourth quarter. Operating margin of 31.6% declined 155 basis points from last Q4. A shift in product mix as K-Cups grew their share of Channel Development revenue in the quarter combined with higher commodity costs totaled nearly 500 basis points of margin contractions. Partial offsetting by margin pressure was a shift in timing of marketing spend and increased sales leverage. Now I will review our consolidated results for the quarter. It was clearly the best fourth quarter Starbucks has ever delivered especially given the persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and the softness in June and July. Consolidated fourth quarter revenues grew 11% to a record $3.4 billion. Net increase was driven by 6% global profitable store sales growth, the 32% Channel Development growth I just discussed, contributions from stores opened over the past 12 months and continued strong performance from our global licensed operations. Our 6% global comp growth was driven by the strong results in the Americas and China/Asia-Pacific regions. Five percentage points of the growth came from transactions with one percentage point from average ticket. Two year comp growth of 15% in the quarter represents acceleration from both the second and third quarters. Consolidated operating income grew 16% to $520 million in the fourth quarter. Operating margin grew 60 basis points to 15.4% driven primarily by increased sales leverage. Commodity costs did not have a material impact on consolidated operating margin in the fourth quarter. Earnings per share of $0.46 grew 24% when excluding the non-routine gains in last Q4. As a reminder those non-routine gains resulted from the acquisition of the remaining equity in our Switzerland and Austria markets and the sale of corporate real estate here in Seattle. The $0.46 EPS of this Q4 includes the $0.02 impact of two items; the $11.5 million store portfolio optimization in the EMEA P&L and the $4.9 million related to the licensing of Ireland that hit our consolidated P&L. The store closures and ownership changes are a key element towards strengthening the EMEA business and represent an important step in achieving our longer-term goal in that region. For the full fiscal year of 2012, the results were equally strong. Total net revenues grew 14% to a record $13.3 billion with 7% global comp growth and 50% growth in Channel Development. The 7% comps were driven by a 6% increase in transactions as we continue to see new customers in our stores while also serving the same customers more frequently. In fact, we are proud to deliver such meaningful growth without relying on significant price increases as by and large we absorbed this spike in coffee costs this year through disciplined cost management and a relentless focus on providing experiences in our stores that encourage frequent customer visits. We also set records for both operating income and operating margin at $2.0 billion and 15.0%, respectively. The operating margin expansion of 50 basis points over 2011â€™s non-GAAP result was accomplished despite a negative 160 basis point impact or $214 million due to higher commodity costs in fiscal 2012. Throughout the year, our operating teams did an extraordinary job of improving efficiency and tightening managing costs, which drove leverage on our strong sales and offset the impact of historically high coffee costs. The result of the revenue growth and margin expansion was record earnings per share, which for the full year reached to $1.79 that equates to 18% growth over last yearâ€™s non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 per share, falling squarely within our stated long-term guidance of 15% to 20% annual EPS growth. We opened 1,063 net new stores across the globe in fiscal 2012. 665 of those were licensed stores, which demonstrates the continued strength of the many valuable licensed partnerships we have around the world, and then nearly, 400 company-operated stores we opened in 2012 are exceeding our first year sales projections indicating another class of stores that will contribute to long-term sustainable growth. The strength of our business results in significant cash generation, allowing us to invest in our existing portfolio of stores and in future multi-channel growth opportunities while also increasing the cash return to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares of stock. Additionally, today, we announced that our Board has approved a 24% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.21 per share. I will now give you an update to the initial fiscal 2013 outlook that I provided on last quarterâ€™s call. We continue to target revenue growth in the range of 10% to 13%, driven by mid-single digit comp growth of approximately 1,300 net new stores and continued strength in channel development. The 1,300 net new stores represent an increase over what I provided last quarter, driven by further acceleration in China and Asia Pacific. We now expect CAP to open 600 net new stores in fiscal 2013, with roughly 50% of those been licensed. China will account for slightly more than one half of CAP new stores. Our Americaâ€™s estimate of 600 net new stores and our EMEA estimate of 100 net new stores are unchanged. Capital expenditures are now expected to be near $1.2 billion in fiscal 2013. This increase reflects the growth in new stores, continued focus on renovations as well as investment in additional manufacturing capacity. Full year consolidated operating margin is now expected to grow by approximately 100 basis points over fiscal 2012, as we continue to drive leverage. I will provide operating segment margin targets at our Investor Conference in early December. Given the strength of our global business, the momentum we carry into 2013 and the deep pipeline of profitable growth initiatives, we are raising our fiscal 2013 earnings per share target to a range of $2.06 to $2.15. This represents 15% to 20% growth of our fiscal 2012. While we expect each quarter to fall within that 15% to 20% growth range, our first quarter EPS is expected to come in at the low end of that range. This is due to investments unique to the first quarter, including our leadership conference which was held in early October and cost approximately $30 million and the launch of Verismo. We are positioning Verismo for a significant impact in the years ahead and are approaching that as a major platform launch with significant spend in marketing, sampling and store labor. As a result, we expect that Verismo will produce a net loss of approximately $30 million in the first quarter and a total net loss of $30 million for the full year. The launch of Verismo this quarter is just a beginning. We will build and expand the Verismo platform in order to pursue the multi-billion dollar global opportunity. And finally, we continue to expect a net benefit of approximately $100 million of $0.09 per share in fiscal 2013 due to favorable commodity costs, which is included in our targets. We believe that impact will be spread evenly throughout the year at approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter. 2012 was a phenomenal year for Starbucks by every measure. We strengthened our operational muscle with record productivity in the U.S. and enhanced capabilities around the world. We strengthened our tie to our loyal customers, with enhancements that provide significant rewards through our loyalty program. We strengthened our global portfolio by opening profitable new stores, by closing unprofitable stores and by filling the small markets to local licensees. We strengthened our product line up with significant innovation around refreshment, health involvements, at home coffee, and a huge opportunity in food. We drove strong financial results reaching records for revenues, earnings, operating margin and return on capital and we increased cash returned to shareholders with prudent share repurchases and a growing dividend. We are excited to leverage these strengths and momentum in 2013 in ways that greatly reward our customers, our partners and our shareholders. And weâ€™re confident in our outlook of continued, strong, profitable global growth in the year ahead. With that, Iâ€™d like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Rachel?\n",
      "Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n",
      "John Glass â€“ Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much. I wanted to just go back to the U.S. and the same-store sales that you reported and what the turning point was? We all assumed you entered the quarter in July maybe comping 5%-ish, but you ended at 7%, so it implies there was a fairly dramatic acceleration. So, was that a consistent acceleration to the quarter, was there a bigger response say to the Treat Receipt? And just â€“ and just in general, what other elements do you think drove it, because what you did during the quarter was impressive from a promotional standpoint or from an execution standpoint, but I didnâ€™t think any of those stood out my mind as being events that would drive comp acceleration to this magnitude, so maybe any other color around that would be helpful? Thanks.\n",
      "Troy Alstead: Sure, John, thanks for your question. Let me start just briefly and then Iâ€™ll ask Cliff Burrows, the President of our Americas business to speak more specifically about the actions in the quarter and what the impact of some of those things were. Yes, youâ€™re right, the July, similar to June and as we discussed at our last earnings call in late July, was a soft month for us. Soft, still growing in traffic, still total comp growth growing, but softer than we had been trending earlier in the spring. As we progressed through August and September, we saw a very, very significant recovery in our same-store sales and absolutely exited the quarter in a much healthier place than where we entered the quarter. With that, Iâ€™ll have Cliff speak a little bit more specifically to some of the actions we took.\n",
      "Cliff Burrows: Thanks, Troy. Thanks, John. It really was an intense focus on the operations of our stores and our partners did an amazing job just getting about on daily work and that was focusing on the customers we had in front of us. Treat Receipt was well received by both our partners because theyâ€™re familiar with it and our customers because it was an all-favorite coming back. Between Treat Receipt and LivingSocial, Iâ€™d say that accounted for about 1% comp growth in the period where we run it and we also in this period launched our Refreshers platform, which was in there in handcrafted and in cans in our stores, and all of that gathered a momentum and gave us good pace for the future. So, it really was a great focus on the business and really closed with the way everybody responded.\n",
      "Troy Alstead: John Iâ€™d just add one thing that the public doesnâ€™t see directly and that is the use of all of the social media channels that we were able to leverage. Starbucks is at any given month a leading brand on Facebook and Twitter. As a result of that, we were able to leverage a level of engagement with a large number of customers, millions of Starbucks fans and customers and direct them to the store in ways that really reduced traditional marketing spend. And I think between that the operations that Cliff talked about, the effectiveness of Trade Receipt and LivingSocial, we were in a position and then towards the end of the quarter, we began to have a great result with Pumpkin Spice Latte, which got off to a fantastic start despite the fact that itâ€™s been year-over-year. All of those things bode very well for the quarter; and as we said, a stunning turnaround from Q3.\n",
      "John Glass â€“ Morgan Stanley: Thank you.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Lazard. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Matt DiFrisco â€“ Lazard: Thank you. I just wondered if you can give us a little color on sort of those remodels. I think you touched on about a little over 2,000. What youâ€™re seeing as far as volumes afterwards and the key initiatives to those remodels, I guess, is it longer term for setting up for better products and more products to sell or is there also sort of a near term added benefit with any sort of improvement on throughput during those high peak times, because your traffic number looks extremely strong and Iâ€™m curious if thatâ€™s a reflection in part due to some throughput initiatives?\n",
      "Troy Alstead: Matt, let me start to address it, but Iâ€™m also going to ask Cliff to get into a few more specifics. We have, as you said, a long list of major and minor and everything in between remodels over the past year. And as Howard mentioned, I think 2,000 remodels planned and we expect to be on a pace of level like that for some time. Now I would point out that somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000 remodels, a smaller number, somewhere in the mid-100s are more major significant type of things that might involve a very substantial change or the expansion of a store, the balance of them may involve more minor changes that arenâ€™t just significant remodel of the store. So, itâ€™s a varying degree of impact both on the store itself and on the results to come out of it. Needless to say, Cliff will go into more specifics, but as we do particularly those major remodels on that individual store, we see a very, very, very significant increase in comp growth in that store when we opened.\n",
      "Howard Schultz: The store in Spring Street in SOHO is the prime example of that â€“ of a significant remodel and as a result of that significant return on investment and an enhanced customer experience. I just mentioned that because itâ€™s in New York.\n",
      "Troy Alstead: Yeah.\n",
      "Cliff Burrows: Matt, hi, itâ€™s Cliff. The 2,000 you mentioned is obviously a global number approaching the 1,700 in the U.S. last year and then you fit into those categories that Troy said. And we are focusing on each refurbishment to make sure we treat it like a new store and equip it to deal with the changing customer base and changing demand around peak and at different times of the day. Weâ€™re looking at it to enhance not only the experience, the seating, the flow and introducing innovation like clover and each time we innovate we bring in clover and that really helps us in many ways, helps us to build the relevance with our customers build our coffee authority and that intimacy and just keep raising the conversation around coffee and the level of our execution. And so there isnâ€™t a sort of a general number Iâ€™d give you as the benefit, because each one of them is unique and each one of them we try and do the best thing for our partners in terms of the work environment and our customers in terms of the experience and weâ€™ll do a similar number in the coming year in the U.S.\n",
      "Matt DiFrisco â€“ Lazard: Thank you. I just had one follow-up also. I guess you mentioned a little bit about the Evolution Fresh, the 2,200 West Coast stores, a 100% lift in that. Was that also â€“ Iâ€™m not familiar, I havenâ€™t gone to one of those stores â€“ is that similar to how you did the Refreshers as far as have you combined that with putting the ready-to-drink product out with also any sort of assortment of handcrafted drinks with Evolution Fresh yet?\n",
      "Troy Alstead: If I talk about Evolution Fresh in U.S. Starbucks stores, it is bottled beverages only. We have a range of six of cold-pressed beverages and it ranges from orange juice, which is the most familiar and the best-seller and it goes through to whether itâ€™s sweet drinks or essential vegetables, itâ€™s a wide range. It supports our health and wellness platform and the increase that Howard refers to is a mixture of both ticket and volume, but it has been well-received in every single market. Future innovation will come from our learnings from Evolution Fresh stores, of which we opened the latest one in Fillmore Street last weekend down in San Francisco and as had a fantastic reception locally.\n",
      "Matt DiFrisco â€“ Lazard: Excellent. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Jeff Bernstein â€“ Barclays: Thank you very much. Just I guess a two-part question as we look to CAP and I guess specifically to China. One, just from a unit perspective, it seems like there is obviously an acceleration in openings, I know itâ€™s 300-plus in fiscal 2013, considering you only have 700 in total, obviously thatâ€™s a pretty sizable up tick. Iâ€™m just wondering, if you can give some color around real estate availability, whether youâ€™re seeing increased competition? Weâ€™ve heard from others that perhaps the competitive environment to get these sites is going up and thatâ€™s where the cost is going up with it. So, Iâ€™m just wondering, if you could talk from a real estate perspective? And then the other piece relates to the other driver of top line, which would be comp, and you mentioned I guess the 10% plus comp, which I guess, an impressive string of 11 straight quarters of that double-digit. Iâ€™m just wondering whether you view like you said the deceleration â€“ like how do you decipher between the deceleration due to the compares versus the deceleration due to what you kind of acknowledge was a macro slowdown in China? Thanks.\n",
      "Howard Schultz: John?\n",
      "John Culver: Yeah. Hi, Jeffrey, this is John Culver. First off, the opportunity that we have in China is enormous and we continue to see very strong acceptance of the Starbucks brand and when weâ€™re opening our new stores, weâ€™re opening both in our existing cities as well as new cities. We now are in 52 cities across the country. We opened 12 new cities this past year. And as Troy touched on, weâ€™re seeing a three times sales to investment ratio over the last two years. So all indications for us is that China represents right now the most immediate and fastest retail growth opportunity that the company has in front of us, and with that what weâ€™re doing are making significant investments around our people in terms of ramping up the investment and the hiring and training of people to staff the new stores as well as investment in infrastructure from a supply chain and IT perspective. Weâ€™ve also localized our design resource to help enable speed into the market of opening our new stores and then also invested heavily in research and development so that we can have locally relevant products that match the flavor profiles that our Chinese consumers want. In terms of the real estate that weâ€™re seeing, we are seeing an abundance of available real estate and weâ€™ve invested in local teams in the major provinces in the major cities to go out and to capture that real estate opportunity and what weâ€™re seeing is that weâ€™ve been very well-received in the new cities that weâ€™re in, we are going into. Consumer response, weâ€™re seeing lines out the door and the new stores in these new cities are exceeding our expectations. So weâ€™re very optimistic and very bullish on the opportunity. Weâ€™re going to stay very focused and very disciplined in the investments and monitoring the performance of our new stores and our existing stores and weâ€™re going to continue to drive relevant innovation into the stores so that we can continue to sustain the growth. And as Troy pointed out in his comments also, there is a rebalancing thatâ€™s taking place that as we continue to accelerate the new store growth, more of our sales growth is going to come from new stores versus comparable sales growth. So youâ€™re going to see a rebalancing of the portfolio and as part of that more company-owned stores versus licensed stores which is going to have a slight impact on margin over time.\n",
      "Jeff Bernstein â€“ Barclays: Is it â€“ just to follow up, are you seeing any sign just from the macro perspective versus the compares whether or not you think consumer shifting to lower-priced items or any kind of mix â€“ anything concerning versus just compare driven slowdown in comp?\n",
      "John Culver: I havenâ€™t seen anything thatâ€™s concerning to me at this point in time. I mean we monitor this very closely, obviously are aware of others â€“ peopleâ€™s challenges in China, but for us, weâ€™re continuing to make the investments. Weâ€™re taking a long-term view and weâ€™re pushing forward.\n",
      "Troy Alstead: And Jeff, I would also just add to that that we are continuing to grow traffic in China, weâ€™re continuing to grow ticket in China, weâ€™re growing healthily across all day parts and the two-year comp growth is remaining very, very, very strong if you compare that over the last several quarters. I think that speaks to the fact that, yes, weâ€™re up against tougher compares. It wasnâ€™t all that long ago just a couple of years ago, where average unit volumes in our business in China were roughly a third U.S. levels. They are now well greater than half U.S. levels and catching up and by the way that comes at a point in time when average unit volumes in the U.S. have been growing and are at all-time record levels here in the U.S. and yet China has been growing quickly. So we donâ€™t see any concerns about growing volumes whatsoever.\n",
      "Howard Schultz: John?\n",
      "John Culver: Hey, Jeff, just one other thing Iâ€™d like to also comment on in terms of real estate, one of the things that we did earlier this year is host the first ever landlord real estate conference in Summit where we brought in all the major owners of key developments across China. And Howard and I and Arthur Rubinfeld had the opportunity to sit and address them and talk about the investments weâ€™re going to make in China from a growth perspective, talk to them and share new designs and really start to build the unique partnerships that we wanted to go after with these key landlords and that is paying huge dividends for us.\n",
      "Jeff Bernstein â€“ Barclays: Very helpful. Thank you.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Sara Senatore â€“ Sanford Bernstein:\n",
      "talk a little bit about: A, what your expectations are for the demand environment given that I donâ€™t think the overall environment got better just you seem to reaccelerate? And, B, if you can talk a little bit about in terms of contributions, is it more from new products, is it from Verismo, is it from things like â€“ more like the Treat Receipt more â€“ being a little bit more aggressive on social media that kind of thing? Just so we have some comfort in the bottoms-up driver of the comps?\n",
      "Howard Schultz: This is Howard. Iâ€™ll start, I think itâ€™s very interesting and multidimensional question. If you look at the last few years, there is no question that the economic environment in the U.S. has been very challenging, fragile, and depending on the region, very difficult at times. I would â€“ Iâ€™m not an economist, but I would say that the consumer environment is somewhat bifurcated and has been for a couple of years. And I wouldnâ€™t describe Starbucks literally as a luxury brand, but I think we occupy a very unique space that is the premium brand and luxury brand within our space. At the same time, we are still very much an affordable luxury by not only people who are at the high-end of luxury consumers, but people who can afford Starbucks in all walks of life. In addition to that, I think we have been able as evidenced by Q4 and I think this is really important and highly relevant. Weâ€™ve been able to thread the needle to maintain and preserve and enhance our premium position as a premium brand, while at the same time, developing, offering and creating value propositions for our customers that in no way dilute the equity of the brand, but reward our customers by, in a sense, putting our feet in their shoes and developing value for them. Having said all that, I think we are highly confident that despite any turn in the current economy that we can anticipate that we have the tools, the resources and most importantly, the power in the marketplace to navigate through this by what weâ€™ve been able to learn and the muscle memory that is inside the DNA of the company since transforming the company in 2008. I do think the burden of proof is on companies and consumer brands to recognize there is a seismic change in consumer behavior, as I alluded to in my remarks, as a result of social and digital media and the emergence of mobile commerce and mobile payments. But we are in the most desirable position because of the investments weâ€™ve made over the last few years to not only be the leader in the space, but now have the tools, the resources and the capability to leverage those channels and means in a way that is almost unparallel in the marketplace. So the short answer is, we are optimistic that we â€“ and weâ€™re confident that we can continue to navigate through changes in the economy and weâ€™ve done it now year-over-year and I think turn in Q4 is not only stunning but gives us great confidence as we head into fall holiday in 2013.\n",
      "Cliff Burrows: Yeah, if I can answer, so the other piece I think is about our people. We have invested greatly in our managers and our leadership and giving the tools to our partners to do their work and I think that has really helped us in terms of the amount of time we have to connect with customers, to improve the quality of the customer experience and the relationships we form. I think thereâ€™s nothing better to support that than the fact we have 3 million Gold Card members as part of our My Starbucks Rewards and that just gives this dialogue and immediate feedback and such a richness. And I think just to give you a little bit of additional (inaudible), weâ€™ve seen strong growth across the whole of the U.S. in August and September, and if I look back on the year as a whole, Iâ€™d also say that. And the work weâ€™ve been doing around day parts, whether that is building capacity at peak or enhancing the food offer around other day parts, we have seen growth on all day parts. So we continue to grow at peak in the morning, but also at lunch, afternoons and now into the evenings. And I think that is what gives us the confidence about both the opportunity to grow more stores in the U.S. and to continue to grow average unit volumes by spending on day parts and our ability to deal with peak capacity. Thank you.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Diane Geissler â€“ CLSA: Hello, can you hear me okay?\n",
      "Howard Schultz: Yes.\n",
      "Cliff Burrows: Yes.\n",
      "Diane Geissler â€“ CLSA: I wanted to ask if youâ€™ve seen any changes in the competitive dynamics within the CPG channel given the expiration of the patents on the K-Cups, have you seen any movement there from additional SKUs?\n",
      "Troy Alstead: Diane, weâ€™ll have to introduce Jeff Hansberry, who is on the call and as you know, President of our Channel Development business and he will take that question.\n",
      "Jeff Hansberry: Hi, Diane, thanks for your question. Yes, we have. We have seen the introduction of some private label offerings in the K-Cup space that have been previously announced that I think weâ€™re all aware of and weâ€™re starting to see some of those begin to show up on retail shelves. We have not seen a significant impact though to retail pricing or the competitive space. And in fact, we continue to see strong demand for Starbucks K-Cups from our customers.\n",
      "Howard Schultz: Next question.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Keith Siegner â€“ Credit Suisse: Thank you. I just wanted to ask a question, thinking about all the various initiatives that launched this quarter from Treat Receipt, LivingSocial a number of different loyalty based programs. There was a lot of product news, marketing news and other promotion news in general, some of which was really unique and kind of differentiated. As you enter a period of deflation in 2013 and maybe beyond, does this free you up to say do a little bit more of this activity than maybe you used to? Is Q4 somewhat of the new base level, I mean weâ€™ve seen product in other news working very nicely across the sector and again does this deflation give you an opportunity to say, ramp that effort from maybe what weâ€™ve seen historically? Thanks.\n",
      "Howard Schultz: Thank you for the question. This is Howard. I respectfully say, no. I think all of us at Starbucks are deeply committed to preserving and enhancing the equity of the Starbucks brand. And as a result of that, we want to be extremely disciplined and thoughtful about how, when and with who we might do things that create an offer, whether itâ€™s Treat Receipt that we did on our own or the relationship we developed with LivingSocial. I donâ€™t think that youâ€™re going to see Starbucks go on sale or anything like that. I do think that we have to be ultra-sensitive to the economic issues and the pressure on the consumer, but I think weâ€™ve demonstrated over 41 years that the best anecdote for us is the experience we create in our stores, the quality of the coffee and the level of innovation. I think what we havenâ€™t talked about today is because it isnâ€™t appropriate is the pipeline of products categories and innovation that we have in the near and long-term future, which I think is the strongest pipeline in the history of the company. Weâ€™ve taken great steps to recognize that the status quo in our business or any business isnâ€™t going to be good enough, but I donâ€™t think weâ€™re going to go down the road of discounting Starbucks. Weâ€™re doing things on an ongoing basis that was highly selective at the time and weâ€™re not going to do that on a consistent basis.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Jason West â€“ Deutsche Bank: You guys touched a little bit on the food program that youâ€™re working to roll out with the upgrades there with the La Boulange product line. If you could talk a little bit about what youâ€™ve seen in the West Coast markets where youâ€™ve tested that, if you have any details or anecdotes or figures you could share on that and sort of what it looks like from a customer perspective when you make those changes?\n",
      "Cliff Burrows: Thank you, Jason, itâ€™s Cliff. It is very early days and we have had 10 stores open in San Francisco where we have been developing and testing a specific line of pastries and muffins and the like for the morning business, weâ€™re really encouraged by that, and thatâ€™s really been the very early steps. This week and next week we launch in San Jose and that would be our first time outside of the San Francisco market and that will give us new learnings. The reaction from our partners in our stores about the quality of the food and the enhanced pride theyâ€™ve got to share those products with the customers, the taste is absolutely fantastic and the reaction from customers in the stores we have served it so far has been fantastic. I think weâ€™ll be in a much better position after the San Jose launch to give a bit of color, a bit of a flavor and more detail of our rollout plans at the Analyst Conference in early December in New York. So, nothing specific to share, but weâ€™ve seen a great reaction so far.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Michael Kelter â€“ Goldman Sachs: I had a few margin questions, I guess for Troy. The first is you raised your operating margin guidance for 2013 from 50 basis points to 100 basis points initially to a 100 basis points now. And I wanted to understand the puts and takes there and why you felt comfortable taking the guidance up before the year even started? And secondly, I hear you talk about your visibility into 2014 given coffee cost remain in the $1.60 range, which as I understand it is well below your lock cost for 2013?\n",
      "Troy Alstead: Thanks Michael. Yeah, let me speak to the last part first. We have been doing some buying â€“ early buying into fiscal 2014 on our coffee needs. Weâ€™re not very far into 2014 yet, but weâ€™re going down that path a little bit and weâ€™ll talk about that in a bit more detail at the conference in December. Suffice to say though, as weâ€™ve talked about before, the early read and what we can see is that 2014 is likely to benefit from reduced coffee costs once again. The order of magnitude is too early to tell, but what I point out is that we will exit the year of 2013 with coffee costs significantly lower through our P&L than we entered the year of 2013 coming through our P&L. But again, thatâ€™s a comment given what we see today, with not very much of 2014 locked at this point in time. Now, in terms of margins weâ€™ve raised it today to the 100 basis points of improvement given the number of things that weâ€™ve seen as we come through the fourth quarter, the momentum we have both on the top line as well as the completion of the operating plans that we put together annually in the summer, prior to the start of the new fiscal year. And thatâ€™s given us confidence given again both the growth we see around the world, the investments that we know we need to make in new initiatives and the growth opportunities we have in the future and the margin improvement opportunities we have all throughout the P&L; in supply chain, in operations management, in leverage of G&A, an improvement in Europe, which we are expecting based on, as you heard from Michelle, some of the many changes that her and her team have been tackling over there. So, I would expect margin improvement really in a number of places in our business and itâ€™s all of that I have visibility into, thatâ€™s given me the confidence in the improvement I talked about both in terms of operating margin as well as earnings growth in the year ahead.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS. Your line is now open.\n",
      "David Palmer â€“ UBS: Hi. Congrats on the quarter and the year. I know itâ€™s early days on the Verismo, but what are some of the feedback you are getting from retailers and your own store managers on the machine? The strengths and weaknesses versus other products that are out there in the single-serve market?\n",
      "Howard Schultz: Jeff, you want to start.\n",
      "Jeff Hansberry: Sure. Hi David, itâ€™s Jeff Hansberry. Weâ€™re very encouraged on the Verismo System. For us itâ€™s a first in a number of ways. Itâ€™s the first system that makes Starbucks quality lattes, espresso and brewed coffee all from one machine. We get natural milk pods that are made from real milk, that deliver a great latte and for the first ever weâ€™re able to have Starbucks partners, our baristas actually go out and meet with customers in specialty retail stores and tell the story of Verismo and tell the story of Starbucks. So, weâ€™re off to a very good start. Our shipments are in line with our expectations. But importantly, with a new system like this we are listening very closely to our customer feedback and the majority of feedback is very positive. We are listening for customer opportunities for improvement and weâ€™ll continue to do so.\n",
      "Howard Schultz: Jeff, you want to just address the attachment on pods that weâ€™re seeing? John Culver Well, itâ€™s still very early. Weâ€™re only â€“ we only got a monthsâ€™ worth of data, but at purchase weâ€™re seeing significant multiples of purchases of pods, actually well ahead of our expectations.\n",
      "Howard Schultz: The other thing I would add and I think this is important and Troy alluded to this in his remarks. The launch of Verismo is the launch of a product, but behind the scenes it is the launch of a platform and a deep strategic commitment that we have to the single-serve category domestically and globally. If you look around the world at what Espresso has done building a multibillion dollar business, what Keurig and Green Mountain have done and then the nascent space that we believe exists in Asia and our brand position. This is a global long-term multibillion dollar business and we are just getting started. Verismo is just the beginning.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n",
      "John Ivankoe â€“ JP Morgan: Thank you very much. A question on Europe, specifically if I may, there was a little bit of re-franchising activity I guess in Ireland, specifically you pointed out. Ad I just wanted to get the sense of how much of an opportunity that may exist for existing company store base, whether it is in Switzerland or France or the U.K. or Germany, but have you to perceive more of an asset-like model on those markets and whether theyâ€™d be any constrains to earning pure company store, as well as still maintaining your footprint in any of the major markets where you currently are?\n",
      "Michelle Gass: Hi, John, itâ€™s Michelle. Thanks for the question. U.K. is the central part of our strategy going forward, which is really a sea change in our opening plans. We see the licensing and franchising opportunity as tremendous. And it does a couple of things. First of all, it gives us access to places probably on the high street, which as I mentioned in the call earlier is largely where we are penetrated. And we have not only agreed with our existing great partners like SSP or Autogrill to have a more accelerated plan, but also bringing in new partners like for example in the U.K. Euro Garages, which is going to help us and compliment with us our plans to expand into hundreds of drive-thrus across the region over the next few years. We see absolutely tremendous opportunity but itâ€™s largely about the new growth and our new growth will be dominated by licensing. We also are actively looking at the franchising opportunity and we have put that strategy in place in the U.K. and we are looking to extend that strategy across Continental Europe. And then as it relates to our existing base, weâ€™ll look at smart opportunities that make sense for the business then for our customers.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Greg Badishkanian â€“ Citi: Great, thanks. Maybe if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of the coffee consumer, as well as the competitive landscape in Europe, and maybe any changes that youâ€™ve seen over the last quarter or two?\n",
      "Michelle Gass: Yes. Thank you for the question. As I said earlier we face tremendous competition not only with a, Iâ€™ll call them bigger chains but also with many small operators across the region. As I said I visited now many, many markets throughout my first year and what I will tell you consistently across both our customer and our partner feedback is what the customer is looking for is the Starbucks experience. And that â€“ what we bring is unique product whether itâ€™s our Espresso, our Frappuccino, importantly the environment, free WiFi all of which are assets and weâ€™re also very focused on building like weâ€™ve seen in the U.S. our digital platform, our service rewards platforms etcetera. So I would say that there hasnâ€™t been tremendous change for say over the year, but we are getting a lot closer to the customer and navigating in ways to bring local relevancy and that relates to, as I mentioned, focusing on espresso, bringing a new level of innovation in that category, and Iâ€™ll be speaking to that when weâ€™re together in December and thatâ€™s not only with products but in delivery systems. Itâ€™s also around our food and importantly our environment. Weâ€™ve now built a local design team in Europe, like in Amsterdam and some in the U.K. to really bring that local design edge to the customer experience.\n",
      "Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Bonnie Herzog â€“ Wells Fargo: Hello.\n",
      "Howard Schultz: Hello. Hi Bonnie.\n",
      "Bonnie Herzog â€“ Wells Fargo: Hi. Just sticking on Europe, I just have a few questions. Could you provide more color on how you expect to improve your food offering in Germany and then in general what are some of the steps you are taking to develop a deeper consumer connection throughout Europe and then how long do you anticipate this will take? And finally, could you talk a little bit more about your action plan to fix some of your supply chain issues in the region?\n",
      "Michelle Gass: Sure. Thank you, Bonnie for the question. I think there is few layers to that. First, let me address the customer experience. To build on what I said, really emphasizing what Starbucks has done so brilliantly over the last 40 years, is the first half get hand and we have done some things new in the region that we havenâ€™t done anywhere else in the world at this scale, which is things like deepening the personal connection, names on cups, names on partners. And I can tell you that on roundtable since weâ€™ve put that in place the customers are really seeing this now as a unique thing that Starbucks does. And they are getting to know their customers in much deeper ways. Weâ€™re taking advantage of our social media channel. We are outpacing many of competitors in the region. We have more than doubled our presence in Facebook and Twitter. We have done new websites across the region, both in company-owned and in licensed stores, all of which are surrounding and enhancing the customer experience. As it relates to food, weâ€™ve made nice progress. I will tell you weâ€™re just getting started. In the U.K. we re-launched our muffin platform; dramatic improvement in quality. Weâ€™re seeing that show up in customer response and in our sales. Weâ€™re also doing some testing on new distribution models for food. Weâ€™re working through and we stated this throughout the year. We had a major change in our logistics and weâ€™re working through that. Weâ€™re very confident that as we move to the year ahead weâ€™ve worked out some of the start-up challenges that any retailer would have with that scale of a change. And then to your specific question around Germany. As we studied the food opportunity there, there is lots of regional opportunities that we can take advantage of. The core Starbucks and the customer of Germany they want the core offerings. They want the muffins and the cakes and we have an opportunity to do a better job there.\n",
      "JoAnn DeGrande: Thank you, Michelle. That concludes Starbucksâ€™ fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2012 conference call. We thank you all for joining us. Weâ€™ll talk to you again in early December at our Biennial Conference. Thank you and good day.\n"
