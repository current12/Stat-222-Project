      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Today we reported revenue of $664.2 million, and a GAAP net loss of $0.37. This included a one-time tender offer to purchase employee stock options that were significantly under water. On a non-GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $0.09 per share. Revenues grew 38% over the previous quarter as we gain market share in both channel sell-out and OEM inventory replenishment increased.  During the quarter, we made good progress managing operating expenses and reducing inventory. We have ongoing initiatives to reduce operating expenses further while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives, which are: one, maintaining our GPU leadership; two, driving the GPU computing revolution; three, increasing the adoption of GPUs in all segments of computing; and four, leading the mobile computing revolution.  Our discrete desktop GPU share increased again this quarter. In the discrete desktop GPU segment, we gained 6% to 69%.  Our notebook and desktop GPU share are about the same and the desktop GPU has exceeded our previous record levels achieved during Q1 of 2008. In addition to graphics leadership, our strategy is to lead the industry to the next level with physics processing. With our physics engine and library, which is available for PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and the iPhone, game developers can create amazing environments using physics simulations that are dynamic, realistic, and interactive with the player.  PhsyX has been adopted by EA, THQ, 2K Games, and most recently, Sega. We have built up a rich pipeline of exciting games with PhsyX support. Mirror’s Edge and Sacred 2 have shipped and received rave reviews, and we anticipate the release of Terminator Salvation, Dark Void, Darkest of Days, You Wars, and Cryostasis -- each of these titles, when run over the 100 million NVIDIA CUDA GPUs in the market will experience a dramatic speed-up. Physics processing is extremely taxing even for the highest-end CPUs. By offloading the processing to CUDA, the parallel computing mode of our GPUs, we can speed up physics processing by an astonishing five to 20 times. And it’s clear now that physics processing is becoming a must-have technology, just as programmable shading has been the last five years.  Utilizing the GPU for parallel computing is one of our most important strategic initiatives. We invented CUDA to harness the massive computational resources in a GPU that is otherwise used only for 3D graphics. The adoption of CUDA is global and GPU computing has reached the tipping point.  GPU computing will be incorporated into the two most important operating systems in the very near future -- Windows 7 with DX compute, and OS 10 Snow Leopard with Open CL will incorporate GPU computing into the core operating system and the GPU will become indispensable to achieve a great computing experience. This quarter we released our first Open CL drivers to developers who participated in our open CL early access program and demonstrated DirectX compute on Windows 7 at the Game Developers Conference.  There’s a growing lists of consumer applications that are accelerated by CUDA. I spoke about physics processing that will be in nearly every game. This quarter, motion DSP [D-Reveal], ArtSoft’s SIM HD, Cyberlink’s Espresso, Nero Move It, and Super [Loylascope] announced support for CUDA.  CUDA has opened up the high performance computing market to our GPUs. We server this multi-billion dollar new growth market with a product line called TESLA. This is a greenfield market for us and our three-year effort has given us a significant lead to the competition. We have traction in virtually every major high performance computing category from finance to oil and gas to medical imaging, to super computing centers. We have significant projects throughout the U.S., Asia, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Europe, Eastern Europe, and India. Success stories are surfacing from all over the world. This quarter in China, Geostar is performing the search for oil and gas using TESLA. Working with the Institute of Geology and Geophysics as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Geostar has demonstrated its solution of running 600 times faster than what was previously possible with a CPU-based cluster.  French banking giant BNP Paribas Corporate and investment banking division recently replaced 500 CPU cores with just eight TESLA GPUs. They sped up response times by 15X while consuming less than one-tenth the power. BNP Paribas effectively reduced the energy consumption of performing the same calculation by nearly 200 times. Increasing computation throughput while reducing cost and energy consumption has become a mission critical imperative for nearly every company.  We announced this week the TESLA GPU pre-configured cluster, which increases the accessibility of super-computing clusters to the millions of engineers, scientists and researchers around the world. The TESLA pre-configured cluster is a ready-to-install super-computer that is available from a network of certified TESLA vars including [Cray], Penguin, [Apro], [Colfax], James River, and many others around the world.  We believe a GPU can dramatically enhance the performance of a PC of any budget. We created ION to bring the benefits of the GPU to the smallest and most affordable PCs. The recently announced Acer Aspire Revo is a full Vista Premium PC available at the price of a basic entry level machine, yet it provides everything the mainstream consumer wants from a PC, including very high quality Blu-Ray playback and modern DX10 games. Because of the ultra-high integration and lower power of ION, Acer was able to create a small, quiet, provocative industrial design that is light enough to hang on the back of your display.  Last week, the first 5,000 Revos delivered to Germany e-tail sold out in one day. The Aspire Revo has been winning rave reviews. Digital Trends predicted that it should be one of the most successful desktop products released this year.  ION has forever changed what consumers can expect from the mainstream PC. Even affordable and small PCs can be wonderful and deliver the full PC experience. More ION based platforms will be available from virtually every major PC OEM. You can expect to hear a great deal in the months ahead about the many ION design wins.  At the World Mobile Conference in February, we revealed our Tegra Netbook. At less than one watt of power, Tegra can surf the web and present the full high resolution experience to the Internet. With Tegra, we are enabling a new class of web-based computers that is high resolution like a PC, yet always on like a smartphone. We now have Tegra design wins that range from portable media players, smartphones, netbooks and other new classes of mobile Internet devices. Research from iSupply projects shipments of Internet enabled devices ranging from ultra-mobile PCs to portable media players to increase nine-fold in the next four years.  More than 400 million of these devices will be shipped in 2012, an annual compound growth rate of better than 50%. We look forward to announcing exciting Tegra devices in the coming months. Our nearly four-year investment in Tegra has positioned us squarely at the center of the next computing revolution. We estimate that Tegra has opened up an additional $10 billion growth market for us.  Now let me introduce David White, who succeeded Marv Burkett earlier this year as CFO. David brings 25 years of experience to the role, most recently as CFO of [Samnia SCI]. He is already making a big impact here. I want to take this opportunity to thank Marv for his enormous contributions to NVIDIA over the past six years. Marv leaves a legacy that he can be very proud of. He is continuing in an advisory role, working with David and me to facilitate a smooth transition and taking on projects that can benefit from his expertise.  With that, let me turn the call over to David. \n",
      "David White: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. My comments today will focus on a review of our first quarter results of operations, both on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, along with a discussion of selected balance sheet accounts and cash flows. I will then conclude with comments regarding our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. As Jen-Hsun indicated in his opening comments, revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $664 million, which was up 38% from $481 million in the prior quarter, and significantly higher than our estimate, which was flat to slightly up.  We reported a GAAP net loss of approximately $201 million, or $0.37 per share. Our GAAP net loss included a one-time charge of $140 million associated with a cash tender offer we previously announced to purchase certain employee stock options. This compares to a GAAP net loss of $0.27 per share in the prior quarter.  Excluding the stock option tender offer, as well as other stock-based compensation, we reported a non-GAAP net loss for the quarter of $47 million, or a net loss of $0.09 per share. This compares with an $0.18 non-GAAP net loss per share in the prior quarter.  Let me now turn to our individual businesses -- our GPU business, which includes desktop, notebook, and memory -- represented 53% of our total revenue and recorded a 44% revenue increase quarter over quarter. Much of this increase was driven by the strength of the desktop segment, which was up almost 50% quarter over quarter. You will recall that last quarter’s revenue in this segment was negatively impacted by low sell-in to the channel as our channel partners worked to aggressively deplete excess inventories. Channel inventories now appear to have stabilized at slightly over one month’s supply, with our Q1 sales into the channel roughly approximately channel sales out. As such, our desktop revenue figures in Q1 more closely approximately true end-market demand than what we had experienced in Q4.  The notebook segment of our GPU business was up 28% quarter over quarter, driven primarily by increased OEM demand, which comprised the vast majority of this segment. Here also, fourth quarter revenues were abnormally impacted by OEM inventory corrections that have now abated.  Our MCP business, which represented 28% of our total revenue during the quarter, was up approximately 94% quarter over quarter. Demand was primarily driven by our chipset products designed for the mainstream AMD integrated desktop segment, as well as our chipset products designed for the Intel-based notebook segment.  Revenue for our PSB business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, was essentially flat quarter over quarter and represented 16% of total revenue. Our share in this segment remains stable -- corporate demand, which comprises a substantial percentage of this business, has not shown any signs of economic recovery at this point. This reflects constrained budgets and consumer redeployment and upgrade activity of older equipment.  Looking at the business as a whole, GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 28.6%. Excluding charges associated with a stock option tender offer, as well as other stock-based compensation, non-GAAP gross margin was 30.6%.  Our non-GAAP gross margin, which fell short of expectations and estimates, was impacted by several items. First, while revenue in our PSB business was flat quarter over quarter, as a percentage of total company revenue, it accounted for less of the total. Because our PSB business is generally more profitable than the rest of our business, this had an overall negative impact of approximately four points on gross margin.  Second, gross margin was also negatively impacted by the sell-off of some of our older 65-nanometer product, the effect of which was only partially offset by various reserve true-ups.  GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $421 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which again excluded charges associate with the stock option tender offer, as well as other stock-based compensation, amounted to $260 million, essentially flat quarter over quarter and consistent with our estimate.  Payroll related expenses were up quarter over quarter, due to the holiday shut-down in the fourth quarter, and additional FICA based payroll taxes we accrued in the first quarter. However, this increase was largely offset by cost reduction efforts that we realized elsewhere.  Our GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was a benefit of 10.4% and our non-GAAP tax rate was a benefit of 7.5%. NVIDIA's worldwide employment at the end of the quarter stood at 5,480, up 60 from the fourth quarter. We essentially have a hiring freeze in the U.S., with only the most critical positions being filled.  Turning to the balance sheet, accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $304 million, which equated to a DSO of approximately 42 days, an improvement of approximately 18 days from the prior quarter.  Inventories at the end of the quarter were $327 million, down $211 million, or 39% quarter over quarter. Inventory days at quarter end were 64. This compares with 145 days at the end of the prior quarter. These reductions resulted from rescheduling actions we took in response to our high inventory carryover from Q4, as well as early implementation of the staging of inventories at a pre-finished state just prior to custom configuration. We believe this latter change is important to us because it will enable us to better respond to changing market demand while at the same time maintaining overall inventory levels.  Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to approximately $51 million, slightly up from $48 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter amounted to $21 million, which as a result of our cost reduction efforts, was significantly down from the $43 million we spent in the prior quarter.  Accounts payable at the end of the quarter were $226 million, up approximately $7 million from the prior quarter, and our free cash flow for the first quarter was a positive $121 million.  Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities at the end of the quarter were approximately $1.34 billion, up approximately $83 million quarter over quarter. This figure is significant considering we paid out approximately $82 million associated with the stock option tender offer we completed in March.  In closing, let me briefly comment on our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2010. While it was particularly difficult during these economic times to place a high degree of certainly in market demand and the pricing environment we compete in, our outlook for the second quarter is as follows: we expect revenue to be up quarter over quarter in the range of 5%. As for gross margin, while we are not expecting any near-term improvement in demand in the workstation market, we do believe cost reduction efforts will allow us to improve margins. Accordingly, we expect our GAAP margins to be in the range of 32% to 34%.  We expect GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $280 million. \n",
      " : This concludes my remarks. I thank you for your time and with that, I would like to open the call up for questions. Operator, can we take questions at this point. \n",
      "Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Good afternoon, guys. Can we talk a little bit more about the inventory -- can you talk -- can you give us a little more detail about were there any inventory write-downs and did you sell through any -- or you mentioned you sold through some previously reserved inventory. Can you quantify a little better what the write-offs were or how much of the reserves that there were that you sold through with essentially zero cost, and how much still had some cost associated with it?\n",
      "David White: We have actually a couple of situations -- we have inventory that we completely wrote off in a prior period. We also have inventories that we wrote down to market value. Some of those inventories in both categories were sold during the quarter, some of which we had gains on, some of which we had losses on. It turns out that the losses we experienced on the sale of that inventory plus some of the other products actually offset that by a greater amount, and so on a net basis, it was actually a negative impact to the quarter. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: And was that basically because you, of the amount that you had written down, you hadn’t written it down enough?\n",
      "David White: That’s correct. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: So is that -- \n",
      "David White: In some cases. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: In some cases -- did that then trigger any other accounting accruals on the balance sheet and is that part of what explains the inventory, the big inventory drop as well?\n",
      "David White: There was also a modest amount of new lower cost [to market] accruals as well. On a net basis, it was negative, as I indicated. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Okay. Thanks, that makes sense. And then, when you talk about the gross margin improvement going into the next quarter, how much of -- number one, do you expect any additional inventory write-downs or do you expect to sell through any inventory that has previously been reserved for? And then can you help quantify a little bit further what that improvement is coming from? Is it just mix shift back to PSB or is it mix shift within GPU as well, perhaps some of the newer products, like the 40-nanometer products?\n",
      "David White: In the outlook for the second quarter, we’ll repeat much I think of the same scenario we had in the first quarter. We will continue to sell off some inventory that we have written off and we will continue to sell some inventory that we have written down to lower cost of market. Right now, I would anticipate that the net effect of those two would be roughly a wash. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Okay, and then what kind of improvement to gross margin do you expect from the mix shift to not just the professional solutions business but also from the newer products? The newer GPU products, I mean?\n",
      "Jenny Shanks: David, obviously we are ramping 40-nanometer very aggressively but we haven’t announced any new products yet, and so it’s not appropriate to talk about new products right now.  In terms of next quarter’s gross margins, obviously we have consumed a lot more of our 65-nanometer inventory this quarter and I think that the amount of our 65-nanometer inventory at this point is quite negligible. And so that is going to help our gross margins going forward.  Those are the biggest levers and we are looking forward to having the PSB business coming back online as the enterprise starts to buy again. We have really exciting new products for Quadro that we’ve launched and that the OEMs have already geared up, and so as soon as the end market comes back to life, I think that the workstation business is going to do really well for us once again. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Okay, great. Thanks very much. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.\n",
      "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Thanks. Jen-Hsun, on the 40-nanometer, since you brought it up, I know you are not going to talk about new products that are not announced but can you give us an update on how the ramp is going relative to previous process nodes in terms of the ramp, the volumes, and can you give us an update on what percentage of the mix by the end of the year could be coming through that process node? Thanks. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Let’s see -- the ramp is going fine. It’s during the -- you know, we are ramping 40-nanometer probably harder than anybody and so we have three products in line now in 40-nanometer and more going shortly. So there’s -- this is a very important node. TSMC is working very hard. We have a vast majority of their line cranking right now with new products, and so we are monitoring yields and they are improving nicely week-to-week-to-week, and so at this point, there’s really not much to report.  In terms of the mix towards the end of the year, let’s see -- I haven’t -- my rough math would suggest about 25%, is my guess. I mean, there’s still going to be a lot of 55-nanometer products. A lot of our MCP products, ION, for example, is still based on 55-nanometer and ION is going to be running pretty hard. I think you heard in David’s comments earlier that our Intel chipset product line is our fastest growing business and so my sense is that that’s going to continue to be successful and that is still in 55-nanometer. So I would say roughly 25% to 30% is my rough estimate going into the end of the year. \n",
      "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.\n",
      "Glen Yeung - Citigroup : Could you just clarify again your OpEx guidance for the July quarter? Because I think I heard that it’s going to be up Q-on-Q, and I just wanted to make sure I heard that right.\n",
      "David White: It’s not up. It’s about $280 million on a GAAP basis. \n",
      "Glen Yeung - Citigroup : On a GAAP basis -- and what would it be on a pro forma basis?\n",
      "David White: The guidance we are giving for SBC for next quarter is around $25 million. \n",
      "Glen Yeung - Citigroup : Okay, and then can you give us a sense, David -- when you look into the end of the fiscal year, for example, what are your thoughts about the kind of run-rate of operating expenses you expect to be on at that point, or really what I am asking, you make the point in the comments that you’ve got OpEx programs in place. I just want to get a sense of maybe what those are and what the targets are for that program. \n",
      "David White: So I think in the first quarter conference call, we talked about a stretched goal for the company of about $265 million, and we are still working aggressively to achieve that objective. We have a lot of programs, as Jen-Hsun talked about in his comments, that we absolutely want to maintain our investments in and we feel strongly about the return we will ultimately achieve from those investments. And so our cost reduction activities are trying to balance maintaining all of the resources we can on those investments and still trying to spend our money as wisely as we possibly can, and so we are focusing on a lot of ways in terms of how we manage our expenses and where our expenses are actually incurred, and trying to influence them in ways that won’t affect those programs. So I think the $265 million target is still intact and we are -- I assume we will achieve that sometime in the next -- certainly before the end of the calendar year and our fiscal year. \n",
      "Glen Yeung - Citigroup : Okay, and one last one maybe for Jen-Hsun -- maybe talk about the pricing environment that you are seeing out there. Obviously we are in a unique demand environment here and any sense that you are seeing anything unique on pricing as a result?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Pricing is -- I would characterize as aggressive, but we are at a point now with the pricing where we think that we are going to be relatively stable for some time. And our products gain a premium in the marketplace relative to the competition, because of the reputation of our products and the performance of our product and increasingly the work that we do around physics and CUDA is being recognized as important, and I commented earlier the number of games that are coming out with PhsyX in the game are -- it’s coming out in a really rich pipeline now and we are seeing game titles coming out on a regular basis now with PhsyX included.  And when you compare a game with PhsyX in it running on CUDA to one that is running on the CPU, the difference is so substantial that our GPU is just superior on so many different fronts. And so I think that we are going to leave our positioning in the marketplace with a premium to our products because it is a superior product and I think the market is recognizing that. \n",
      "Glen Yeung - Citigroup : Thanks. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.\n",
      "Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you very much. David or Jen-Hsun, anyone can answer -- can I please ask you about how the quarter progressed? Because if I look at the DSOs, it seems to have dropped off quite sharply, so can you just give me a sense of how, month-by-month, the quarter progressed in terms of demand? Because looking at this one made me conclude that it looks like demand tailed off towards the end of the quarter. Is that the right conclusion?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Actually, it didn’t. The quarter was a pretty solid quarter, I would say. In fact, we had spot shortages of several products and there were rumors of us pushing our supply chain really hard to get products out into the marketplace, and all of that is true. And we came into the quarter looking pretty good, so I think our -- the market is still uncertain and we monitor sell-out in every single geography for every single product like crazy these days, and so we’ll continue to watch it but so far, so good. \n",
      "Uche Orji - UBS: Okay. Just going back to -- David, going back to the margins, I think in the very first question, you were explaining that the impact of the inventory products that were sold, that the reserve was negative. So what is the cleanest gross margin? So if I walk off 30.6, and if I had to make adjustments for this inventory that were reserved and sold that had a negative impact -- I am trying to get a sense of what then is a clean gross margin for the quarter that just ended. \n",
      "David White: Well, I guess it depends on what your definition of clean is, I guess. Probably the single largest item that impacted margins in the quarter really is the fact that our workstation business, our PSB business, as we call it, was a smaller mix, percentage of the total mix. And as I indicated in my comments, that was about a four point hit on margins. And it overwhelms, actually, the other factors. It is the single largest item and as we gave our guidance, we are not anticipating at this point that is going to change any time soon, so if you wanted to find a clean quarter as our workstation business being back at the historical levels it’s been, you could add four points to margin.  I think the other items that I indicated are a much smaller consequence. \n",
      "Uche Orji - UBS: Sure. And just the last question on the workstation business, obviously watching the end markets [inaudible], it looks like things sure looked pretty challenged for some time. Let me ask you about competition in this market -- I mean, we’ve seen some of AMD’s products getting designed into some HP workstations. Are you starting to notice any signs of improved competition? Are these products getting any traction that may affect your longer term market share in this area? That’s my last question. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: We are frankly not seeing competitive pressure in our workstation business. I think the competition has repeatedly claimed design wins in the workstation business for years now and this is just not a -- it’s not a chip business. This is a chip and a system solution, system software. It’s a complicated business and you are building products that needs to not only be great at Windows but Linux and just about every ancient operating system on the planet. And so it’s a very, very complicated business and the reason why our market share is so high has a lot to do with the investment that we put into it, and so this is -- this is a business that is about solving some of the most challenging problems in computing in the world and we are really, really good at it, and so I think we read about press releases from the competition from time to time and we take it all seriously but the fact of the matter is, it just takes a lot more investment than that to be successful.\n",
      "Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Thank you. A quick question on the ION revenue contribution -- you guys had a huge revenue upside in the first quarter. A lot of that was due to improving sellout demand. How much was that related to the ION business and a related question, what were the gross margins on the ION business and what were the pricing ASPs on the ION?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: So let’s see -- hey, David, what was our Intel chipset business this quarter? Do you have the numbers over there? Total Intel chipset business? We basically only have one Intel-based chipset that we are shipping in any meaningful amount, so -- \n",
      "David White: I don’t have it broken out, Jen-Hsun, between the two here with me. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: What was the total -- was it about $200 million, $180 million or so?\n",
      "David White: $180 million is the total. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Okay, and so I would expect about -- out of that $180 million, about two-thirds of it, maybe a little bit less than that comes from the ION chipset and the way to think about that is in Q2 of last year, one year ago, that amount was approximately zero and so that gives you a sense for the adoption of our products in that segment. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Right, but are you including the 9400M that you are showing to Apple as the -- as ION or is this actually two-thirds of that $180 million design wins with other companies outside of Apple that are using ION?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: We don’t distinguish the two -- I mean, it’s the same processor from our perspective. The -- we call it the platform ION and increasingly people are calling the chip ION, and so we don’t distinguish the two, whatever people want to call it. I mean, when people buy the chipset from us, they call it ION. When the put it into the box and they brand it from the outside, because GeForce is such a terrific brand and contributes so much to the brand value of the end product, people call it GeForce. Do you see what I’m saying? So people buy the ION but they sell it as a GeForce. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Yeah, I’m just trying to get a better understanding of what additional design wins with other PC manufacturers outside of Apple are you getting with ION? I am trying to get an understanding of again the traction of ION outside of just the Apple business that was announced a few quarters back.\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: If you estimate that Apple represents a little bit north of 50% of that, then I think it’s relatively correct. So the traction is good, and if you think about who the fastest growing PC companies are in the world, I think that’s Apple and Acer and [Asus Tech] and -- you know, they are all huge ION customers. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   And any sense of what the gross margins or ASPs on that platform were in this quarter?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: About or better than corporate average. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   The corporate average of this quarter of 30.6% or just what you have done historically?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Better than this quarter. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   All right. And then, can you give us any update in terms of the GT300 architecture, or the next generation architecture? Is that on schedule for the second half of ’09 or do you foresee any potential roadblocks with that rollout?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: We don’t comment about future products. Our current products are doing very, very nicely in the marketplace. What’s the point of talking about future products?\n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Okay, and just on the -- going on in terms of the revenue guidance of up 5%, how should we be looking at it in terms of individual business units? Should we be looking at kind of normal seasonality across the difference categories? And then should we be looking at the workstation business getting back up to like say 20% of total revenue, which has historically been in that range?\n",
      "David White: I would -- if I was modeling it out, I would assume workstation is flat and apply the 5% ratably to the other businesses. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   So even with the flat workstation business, which carries a higher gross margin, you are still expecting 32%, 34% of GAAP gross margin?\n",
      "David White: Yes. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Okay. What is it on a non-GAAP basis? Are you able to break that out?\n",
      "David White: It’s not much different. SBC is like 20 bps, 0.2 -- small difference. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Stifel Nicolaus.\n",
      "Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Thank you. This is Patrick Newton in for Cody Acree. This question goes to Dave -- I guess if you could speak a little bit -- if we started looking out at long-term gross margin, what does it take to get us back into the 40% range? And I guess is this something that you guys think is achievable in the fiscal ’11 timeframe?\n",
      "David White: I guess I would throw in a couple of things here. One is -- Jen-Hsun, you can jump in here, obviously -- our business and margins are heavily influenced by our high-end performance products and clearly as we move forward and TESLA and TEGRA and some of these other products that we have been talking about and continue to invest in become a part of our revenue mix and so forth, we believe that within that time period, we can be getting our margins back up into that kind of arena. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: If you look at our history, there was a time when we were -- we had rather low gross margins, and I think it was as low as 28 points, or something like that. And we, over the course of about a year-and-a-half, methodically worked our gross margins back up and exceeded our record levels.  I have every confidence that the operational initiatives that we have in place today that looked at the reasons why our gross margins are challenged right now and the new mix of products that we are bringing to the marketplace and our -- you know, my full confidence that the industries will be revived and I will need to buy tools for their engineers, who are the hearts and souls of all industries, you know, will return. And when that happens, our gross margins have every opportunity to return to its record levels and potentially beyond. And so those are things that we are putting in place and the teams are executing fabulously across the board. If you watched us the last time, relentlessly march up our gross margins, we intend to do exactly the same this time. \n",
      "Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Thank you. And then moving on, so talking about some of these new products that you guys just touched on, TESLA and TEGRA, could you talk about what kind of revenue you saw from TESLA in this quarter, and maybe some kind of expectation throughout the remainder of the fiscal year? And then also in regard to TEGRA, if you could talk about some -- if there’s been any recent change in design win momentum and any expectations you have for TEGRA in the back half of the year ramping perhaps a target run-rate exiting the fiscal year?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: TESLA was many millions of dollars and next quarter will be more, is my expectation. The traction that we are getting designing them into clusters all over the world, as I mentioned in my comments, are really doing terrifically and the national labs around the world are all benefiting from stimulus packages as the various governments invest in energy exploration and investing in education, and so I think those are all -- and TESLA is just in a fine spot at the right time. And so my expectation is that TESLA is going to continue do to well and we will grow it into a rather nice business. Hopefully within the next couple of years into a business like Quadro and potentially larger.  TEGRA has -- we introduced a new category for TEGRA at the World Mobile Conference, and this is a TEGRA Netbook. Prior to that, we only had TEGRA smartphones and TEGRA portable media player design wins. Those products are just reaching the final production ready for final design phase and starting to ramp in production, and so we are -- I am expecting revenues this quarter and growing throughout the rest of the year. But this last quarter, we introduced a TEGRA netbook reference platform and we have many ODMs and OEMs working with us to bring TEGRA Netbook to the marketplace.  You know, the telcos have discovered that when they can give away a computer with a subscription and that computer is a couple hundred dollars, they can really drive subscription rates, and so we are pretty excited about this and the telcos are pretty excited about it as well, with 3G data modems becoming so affordable, this is really a terrific way for them to increase their revenues.  And the ARPU for a netbook that is high resolution and readily accessible so that you can stream high definition video or use Facebook wherever you are, the telcos are pretty enthusiastic about the type of ARPUs they will generate from these type of devices.  So I think this is going to be a new growth category for us and we are working really hard to get it to production. \n",
      "Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : And Jen-Hsun, when we think about TEGRA ASPs, is it right to think of smartphones and then later on, maybe another $10 for mids and then some incremental, maybe $10 for netbooks on top of that?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Let’s see -- help me understand your algorithm again. \n",
      "Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Sorry -- if I think of ASPs for smartphones maybe being in the $10, $15 range, mids being $10 more than that in the $25 type of range, and then netbooks a little bit more -- is that the right way to think of the ASPs for TEGRA?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: I would think of the PNPs to be very similar to smartphones. I think the mids are higher than that. I think your $10 is about right. And then I think netbooks on the high end of mids, so I agree with that. \n",
      "Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Perfect. Thank you very much. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gana with GMP Securities.\n",
      "Alex Gana - GMP Securities: Thank you very much. I am wondering about on the TESLA platforms how you get through or how you are working with potential customers to get some of the software that may be running on legacy hardware or standard hardware over to be TESLA compatible or adoptable in your systems?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: The vast majority of the serious computing clusters in the world run proprietary software. Oil and gas -- proprietary; finance, proprietary, and so there is a large internal development teams that protect these algorithms of theirs like we protect our algorithms and so we work with each one of their engineering teams or development teams to port to TESLA and the porting process is just all over the world and you could go -- and many of them when they do a port are so delighted by the results, they publish a paper. And if you go to Google and google CUDA GPU or NVIDIA CUDA GeForce GPU, you are going to find just reams and reams of paper that show the speed-ups that we talk about.  You can also come to CUDA Zone -- do a search on CUDA Zone and you will see a whole bunch of applications that have been ported and the results that they are seeing. So that’s one method.  We also work with software developers that target the verticals, and so they could be a small consulting firm for computational finance. They could be a small consult or large consulting firm for oil and gas discovery, so we work with them to develop software. And we will also port the major software packages like [Met Lab] and so there’s a piece of software that has been developed for [Met Lab] that accelerates [Met Lab] some 15, 20 times, and there’s some being developed again further to accelerating them further to that.  And so we just -- we approached these applications based on what we think has the greatest potential to serve the market and also the greatest potential for speed-up. And so we just -- we work on all of them at the same time with a rather large dev tech team, a developer relations team, and we are working with the software developers all over the world. And so you just have to work on this one at a time.  Now, the exciting thing about all of this is many of them were re-factoring and re-developing their software to run on multi-core CPUs and because they were so unsuccessful and frustrated by multi-core CPUs, TESLA showed up at exactly the right time, or CUDA showed up at exactly the right time. And so this is a -- this is really a perfect alignment of an industry that’s run out of choices but still needs to see significant speed. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\n",
      "Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could start out on the notebook market a little bit and give us a sense of what you are seeing in that market with respect to mix of discrete and integrated GPUs, and whether you see that -- any shifts that would be permanent there?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Well, in the notebook market, the discrete versus integrated has been relatively stable, I think. Probably about 25% of the notebooks are discrete. It might have been a little lower this quarter -- well, it probably is lower this quarter because of the significant growth of netbooks. And so if you excluded the netbooks, my sense is that discreet has probably gained relatively to integrated graphics. But let’s just assume that it’s relatively flat and going forward, the interesting dynamic is -- and we are anxious to see this play out but we are starting to hear from all over the world that integrated graphics don’t have DX Computer. DX Computer is the single most important new API from Windows 7 and it helps you do amazing things. If you have made a home movie and you put it on your PC and you wanted edit -- you know, add video editing and add some special effects to it and stitch a few photos and videos together, and you want to render it back to a DVD so you can send it to grandparents -- you know, that process without GPU computing is horrific. I mean, to make a one-hour movie, it will probably take you 10 hours to record it. And so with DX Compute, that one hour has become one hour and one hour, and so it’s just a revolutionary speed-up when it comes down to certain types of application that are very parallel and very data intensive, very computer intensive.  And so I think without DX Compute on integrated graphics chips, the question is how will these PCs compete? And so we are seeing a lot more interest in people who need to put GPUs in their notebooks and desktop computers when Windows 7 comes around. \n",
      "Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thanks, and maybe just as a follow-up, could you give us an update on the magnitude of revenues you expect from TESLA in the current fiscal year, please?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: You know, it’s really hard to say exactly but if we did less than $50 million, I would be disappointed and I would be delighted if we are on a run-rate of north of $100 million going out of the year. \n",
      "Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks very much. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with Friedman, Billings, Ramsay.\n",
      "Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: This is Robert for Craig. Thanks for taking my question -- can you give us a better idea of what ASPs did in the quarter for desktops and notebooks for your chips? Thank you. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: David, you probably have that over there. \n",
      "David White: Probably most of our compression on ASPs probably came in the GPU line of our business in some select particular models and so forth. It was a little bit higher this last quarter than what we have traditionally seen on some particular programs on a quarter over quarter basis, that is. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: If you look at ASPs quarter to quarter, it surely should have increased because we gained share in most of our -- well, almost all of our share gains came from the high end. So we gained about 6% share over quarter over quarter, and so that should -- all of that is high-end share, so our ASP should have gone up. \n",
      "Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: And then going forward, do you expect your ASPs to be stable from here, I guess on the lower end stuff?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: I would say that ASPs are relatively stable right now and we are focused on differentiating our products with PhsyX and with CUDA, with GPU computing and the competition’s products are really graphics only and as more and more applications come out that have GPU computing capabilities and ports, and as more and more games have physics, we are going to focus on differentiating that way. S\n",
      "Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with J.P. Morgan.\n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Just honing in on the gross margins for a second, can you clarify something -- did you say that the inventory that you got in, you had an inventory reserve benefit in Q1, did I hear that correctly?\n",
      "David White: What I indicated was that we had inventory true-ups, some of which were unfavorable, some of which were favorable, the net of which, when you netted that against the products that they related to and we sold was a net unfavorable impact on the quarter. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: So it hurt gross margins?\n",
      "David White: Correct.\n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then on the segment level, given the -- if you ex out the options write-down, did your desktop and notebook gross margins fall sequentially, GPU?\n",
      "David White: What was the first part of that though? Can you repeat the first part of that?\n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: If you take out that $11 million charge to COGS and you just look at your segment gross margins, desktop GPU, notebook GPU -- \n",
      "David White: Yeah, we don’t typically look at that included in there anyway. Okay, yes, I understand what you are saying -- no, they did not. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: They did not fall sequentially? \n",
      "David White: Correct. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. So circling back then to the reserve, bad news, what was the dollar magnitude of that?\n",
      "David White: We’ve really not broken that out. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: I see. Okay, and then as options, looking at options going forward, are they going to stay at the $25 million run-rate?\n",
      "David White: That’s about right. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then as far as channel inventories, Jen-Hsun, earlier you mentioned that you believe that at this -- and this is what we are all trying to figure out, is what is in-demand, what is catching up with in-demand -- how do you see channel inventories right now and as you look at your various lines of business, including chipsets, desktop, notebook, which do you think still have some catch-up to do and which do you think have caught-up with in-demand?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: It’s harder for us to tell on notebooks because we don’t monitor sell-outs on notebooks. They are OEM products. But in terms of desktop products, we know that our channel inventory is near all-time lows, and so we continue to have spot shortages of products here and there. And so we are -- my sense is that based on what we are selling in and based on what is selling out and what we believe the channel inventory to be, the market looks relatively stable right now. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Thank you very much. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Global Crown Capital.\n",
      "David Wu - Global Crown Capital: Yes, I am afraid I need some help on understanding gross margin guidance for Q2 -- since the workstation business is not -- it’s not moving up or down as a percentage of revenue, I see a significant bump in your gross margin guidance for Q2. Is that a function of the mix of 55-nanometer or any new products relative to 65-nanometer to give you this meaningful lift in gross margin quarter on quarter?\n",
      "David White: That is certainly a piece of it, yes, absolutely.  \n",
      "David Wu - Global Crown Capital: So that must be the biggest piece, right? Because essentially we are not talking about major differences between workstation business and the rest of the company. \n",
      "David White: Well [there are other] cost reduction measures that we’ve taken as a company. \n",
      "David Wu - Global Crown Capital: I see. Okay. The other thing I was wondering, essentially to expect a nice recovery in the professional solutions business, I guess just look to IT spending, is that the way to look at it? If we have an IT spending recovery in the second half of this calendar year, then the highest gross margin business would come back. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: I think that’s not a bad surrogate, but we also have to think along the lines of creating new products that can save our customers money. We demonstrated at the National Association of Broadcasters the world’s first digital in graphics compositor digital out product and it’s -- we call it Quadro DVP, digital video pipeline. And it’s the first of its kind ever built and it replaces quite a large amount of servers and switches and video mixers and the reception has been just fabulous. And so what we need to do is get into production. As you know, more and more of the broadcasters are streaming off on the web and this product is designed to be able to record in real-time and composite in real-time and stream it real-time on the web. And so that is a growth market and so we think that there are opportunities for us to innovate our way out of this, even if the IT spending doesn’t come back in the near future. So we have all kinds of ideas that we are working on. You’ve been following us a long time -- we’re a pretty relentless bunch of guys and we have lots of good ideas and in spite of challenges, there are always ways to grow.  You know, you look at ION, it’s our fastest growing business because we’ve tapped into a movement towards low-end advanced mainstream computing. You saw that we are gaining share. You saw that we are creating new products like TESLA and TEGRA, both of which saves money, and so we can find new ways to grow, even if the economy is challenged. \n",
      "David Wu - Global Crown Capital: Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Suji DeSilva with Kaufman Brothers.\n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Good afternoon, guys. Nice job on the quarter and inventories there -- in the 5% sequential guidance, is that typical -- is that the linearity you are expecting that similar typical years or is this year any different somehow?\n",
      "David White: Traditionally our July quarter is seasonally the weaker quarter of the year, one of the weakest quarters of the year.\n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: I meant the linearity month to month. \n",
      "David White:  In terms of the second quarter or the first quarter?\n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Correct -- no, the coming quarter. \n",
      "David White: I think the second quarter will be pretty close to the same linearity we had in the first quarter, which was better than average. \n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Okay, and then as we look at the consumer ultra low voltage, CULV opportunity, is that neutral for you, Jen-Hsun, or do you think that’s an opportunity in terms of your content?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: That’s neutral for us because we don’t participate in the mid-range of notebooks anyhow. If you look at our historical notebook participation, we have been only on the top third of the market and the bottom two-thirds of the market has been integrated for just about forever.  We entered into the low-end part of the marketplace recently with MCP 79 or ION and so we are taking share in the mainstream and the low-end part of the market. What’s exciting to me is come Windows 7 and when DX Compute comes out, the difference between a computer that has DX Compute accelerated by a GPU versus one that does not is not a 10%, 15%, it’s 10, 20, 30 times. I just don’t know how -- and it’s not for games. It’s for making movies for your grandparents. And we know that one of the fastest growing consumer products right now is the flip video camcorder and the Sony Wedding -- those things are selling like hotcakes, and they are HD camcorders. People are making home movies and they want to create a home movie and post it on the web or burn a DVD. And so I think the -- finally it’s possible to do video editing because of DX Compute and because of the GPU underneath it that is not excruciating. I mean, it’s a delightful experience and one of these days, if you get a chance to drop by, we’ll just show you how to do it. It’s just incredibly easy. When you can move a video file around and store it the way that you save files, you know, it changes everything.  This is going to be one of the major usage models for Windows 7 and so we are excited about that and I think that all computers, and I made this comment in my remarks, that we believe and certainly I believe that every computer will benefit with GPUs in it. It will reduce the power.  One of the most -- if you read review so the Macbook Air, that has a rather large GPU, GeForce 9400, in a ultra thin and light computer and the power is better than it was before with Intel integrated graphics. People remark about that all over the web, and so it’s because GPUs, using the right tool to do the right job, saves power and when BNP Paribas and others discover that by using the GPU, you can save 200 times the energy because you run a process faster and it consumes less power, you save a lot of energy and energy consumption comes right out of the battery. And so I think that more and more people are just starting to discover that adding another processor that does the right job on the right -- you know, using the right tool for the right jobs, it really saves power, really saves energy. \n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Great, that’s helpful color and one last question, if I can squeeze it in -- Jensen, in terms of TEGRA versus ION, which one do you think has a larger unit TAM? I’m assuming -- I think it’s TEGRA but if you can confirm that. And which one do you think will have more units in the marketplace in say two to three years, TEGRA or ION?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Oh my gosh, TEGRA -- TEGRA, of all of the products in our company, TEGRA has long-term the largest TAM. And the number of -- \n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: In two or three years, you believe there will be more TEGRAs out there?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Oh yeah, I think in two or three years -- surely, surely. I think the -- TEGRA is -- you know, we’ve been investing in TEGRA now for about four years and we have one of our best teams in the company working on this. There’s 500 people working on TEGRA and to build a computer completely from scratch that first on the size of a penny and deliver a full high definition experience, consume less than one watt, it’s just -- when you see it, it’s just absolutely magical and we -- it’s possible to do that and we are just blowing people away when we show it to them. This is -- I really believe this is the second personal computer revolution. We happen to be fortunate to have in our careers experienced two computing revolutions. This is it. We want to be all over it, and so this is an exciting time for TEGRA. \n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck, guys. \n",
      "Operator: There are no more questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jen-Hsun. Please go ahead. \n",

      "Kelly P. Hernandez - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Saeed, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter calendar year 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Sopp, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending April 3, 2015. Roger Krone will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company's strategies. Mark will follow with a discussion of our financial performance for the first quarter and our expectations for the future. After these remarks from Roger and Mark, we'll open the call up for your questions. During this call, we will make references to year-over-year comparisons. Due to the previously announced change in our fiscal year, we will be comparing our just released Q1 calendar 2015 results for the quarter ended April 3, 2015 with our previously reported Q1 fiscal 2015 results, which represent the three months ending May 2, 2014. During the call, we will also make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding the company and our expectations about future financial and operating performance. These statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events to differ materially, and I refer you to our SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. In addition, statements represent our views as of today. Subsequent events and developments could cause our view to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. Finally, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the supplemental information on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kelly. And thank you, all, for joining us this morning for our first quarter, calendar year 2015 earnings conference call. Before I begin, I'd like to spend a moment to thank our CFO, Mark Sopp, on what is likely his last earnings call with Leidos. As you know earlier this year, Mark announced his intention to retire from Leidos, and we are in the final stages of selecting his successor. Mark has been with the company for nearly 10 years and was involved in our initial public offering in 2006 and has been instrumental in growing the company from roughly $7 billion a year in annual revenues to more than $11 billion annually before the spinoff. We wish Mark success and happiness as he embarks on this new chapter in his life. While we're on the topic of management changes, I am pleased to announce that we have successfully concluded the search for our Health and Engineering Sector President. This individual will be joining Leidos in the coming weeks, and we will be making an announcement regarding his appointment shortly. On to the quarter. This morning, we announced our financial results for the first quarter of calendar year 2015. Revenues, earnings per share and cash flow came in generally as expected and we are tracking well to the annual guidance we provided on our last call. Our book-to-bill, both on a consolidated basis and specifically in the national security sector, is up from year-ago levels. While this is a positive development, we recognize that there is still more progress to be made and the true reflection of our BD improvements have yet to bear fruit in this metric. We are making steady progress in our engagement with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, and in April, we signed a contract for the logistics, commodities and service transformation program or LCST. Mark will give you more details on this contract in his remarks. Beyond this, a few other notable wins I'd like to highlight. A $7.2 billion multiple award IDIQ contract by the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command to provide global intelligence support services, $100 million multiple award prime contract by the National Institutes of Health to provide professional information technology and technical services to the NIH Center for Information Technology, a $50 million single award IDIQ prime contract from the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic to provide environmental planning and mission operation support for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft. We are also extremely proud of our federal health team for having won the AHLTA CHCS sustainment contract which was awarded to Leidos by the Defense Health Agency on April 30. AHLTA CHCS is the current electronic health record system supporting the DoD worldwide. As a reminder, the original contract for CHCS was awarded to Leidos more than two decades ago, and we are deeply honored to have been chosen by the DoD DHA in successive competitive acquisitions over this period of time. This award was the result of a highly competitive acquisition process spanning approximately 17 months. Due to timing, we will book this into backlog in Q2. We are pleased that the DoD continues to entrust us with sustainment responsibilities for this mission-critical system having chosen Leidos as the best value solution. Another highlight during the quarter relates to our security products business, which resides within our Health and Engineering sector. Leidos is one of only three companies that has achieved certification by the GSA on its version 7.2 standard for its medium speed explosives detection system. This new standard requires the inspection systems to be able to detect materials of considerably greater complexity and broader composition than in the past. We are currently the only provider of reduced size EDS systems to the TSA. But this most recent achievement will allow us to compete in a new market when the TSA upgrades their aging checked baggage systems. Now, to provide you with an update on portfolio shaping. The sale of our Plainfield Renewable Energy facility is progressing as expected. And we continue to believe the transaction with Greenleaf Power will close in the coming months. There is more to go on portfolio shaping as we continue to evaluate our various businesses. However, we have nothing further to report for now, and we will update you at the appropriate time. Finally, on cash flow and capital deployment, during the first quarter, we had a net use of cash for operating activities of $42 million which was in line with our expectations. We recognized the importance of deploying our excess cash. Our first priority for capital deployment remains paying our dividend. Beyond that, uses for cash or investing for future growth, managing our financial leverage consistent with being considered investment grade and returning value to shareholders. All of these options are evaluated every quarter with our board. Overall, I'm pleased with the quarter and the progress we are making in expanding our served markets, improving our business development results and focusing the company on our core competencies. Our priorities remain on our people, our innovation and our cost, and I firmly believe we are on the right track in all of these areas, not just in the quarter we reported but in what lies ahead. I'd also like to take a moment to recognize our employees for the hard work and dedication to the company and to our customers. Leidos recently received two honors recognizing the culture that our employees have helped to create. First, we were named as one of America's best employers for 2015 by Forbes magazine. And second, we were named again this year, as one of the best employers for veterans by Military Times, for our continued commitment to veteran hiring and retention. I want to thank all of our employees and our hiring managers for their instrumental part in earning these honors for the company. With that, let me hand the call over to Mark Sopp.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Roger, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. It's a good start to the year and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. Consolidated revenues were $1.25 billion for the first quarter, which represents a decline of 5% compared to the first quarter of last year. The pace of revenue declines continue to moderate now for the sixth sequential quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of $80 million represents a margin of 6.4%, down slightly compared to the prior year. As we'll discuss in the sector details, these results include the impact of some discrete expenses, most notably in facilities exit costs which we experienced in January 2015. As a result of the fiscal year change, these discrete items are being reported twice in this calendar first quarter and also in the fourth quarter of our last first fiscal year ended January 30. In total, these discrete items represented a 70-basis-point dilution to our non-GAAP consolidated operating margin in calendar Q1. Excluding which, margins for the quarter would have been 7.1%. Q1 margins were quite strong for our operating sectors, but were offset by higher than normative cost in the corporate segment and I'll cover more on this in a little bit. Conversely, our effective tax rate during the first calendar quarter was below our normative rate as expected due to a combination of beneficial impacts recognized during January 2015 reported both in Q4 of last fiscal year and here again in Q1 of calendar 2015. A more normative quarterly tax rate and what we expect for the rest of this year is approximately 37%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.65, up from $0.59 in the prior year as detailed on slides 16 and 17 of the investor presentation on our website. This was as expected driven by lower net interest expense and lower effective tax rate, and a lower share count from buybacks made in 2014. Operating cash flow used from continuing operations was $42 million and generally in line with our expectations. Receivables management was strong during the quarter resulting in DSOs up 71 days, a 5-day reduction year-over-year. This was offset by a high concentration of annual payments which typically occur in Q1, including annual bonuses and 401(k) contributions. Further, during the first quarter, we incurred a higher level of tax payments relative to our tax provision, which will largely reverse later in the year. Taking the business development results consolidated net bookings totaled $891 million in the first quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.72, slightly above the year ago quarter. We are encouraged by the recent wins and improvements we are making in our BD process. But as Roger said, we recognize, it'll take more time to see the full benefits of recent actions in our book-to-bill metrics given the length of our 12- to 18-month sales pipeline. We ended the quarter with $7.5 billion in total backlog including $2.8 billion which was funded well more than six months of forward revenue coverage. I will point out these book-to-bill and backlog numbers do not yet include any impact from the United Kingdom LCST contract. I'll provide more detail on that contract in a few moments when I cover the National Security Solutions sector. The value of bids outstanding at the end of the first quarter was $16.2 billion, up roughly 35% from Q1 of last year and roughly flat sequentially from Q4. We expect this will decline noticeably once the LCST win shifts from outstanding bids to backlog. Turning now to the select sector results for the first quarter. First, in our National Security Solutions sector, NSS, revenues decreased year-over-year by $82 million or 9%. 70% of this decline was due to the continued reduction in U.S. overseas war related or overseas contingency operations funded business otherwise known as OCO. This pace of the OCO decline is progressing as expected, and we continue to believe our OCO revenues will come in near $200 million for calendar 2015. When adjusting for the OCO decline, our NSS revenues contracted approximately 3% during the quarter, primarily driven by the overall reductions in defense and U.S. government spending outlays from prior year budgets. On to profitability, operating margins in our NSS sector decreased from 8.2% in Q1 of last year to 7.2% this quarter. This decrease again reflects the effect of facilities exit cost discussed on our last call which were incurred in January 2015. Excluding this impact, NSS operating margins were 7.7% this quarter. Before I move on to Health and Engineering, I do want to share some more details with you regarding the UK LCST contract. As Roger mentioned upfront, we did signed the contract in April, however we still must meet certain conditions precedent in order for the program to become effective. We expect those to be resolved in either Q2 or Q3 of this year. Once these items are resolved we expect to book into backlog in the upper $2 billion range in expected revenue contribution from this program over its 13 year term. This figure reflects our expectation that we will use in net accounting on portions of the contract, meaning we do not expect record revenue on the pass through commodity purchases that we will be making on behalf of the Ministry of Defense. Under that assumption, we expect the contract to generate revenues for Leidos of approximately US$225 million per year on a typical run-rate basis. This approximate revenue run-rate represents 5% of our trailing 12 month revenues. Certainly a nice organic growth driver for the company going forward. We expect margins for this contract to start lower in the initial stage and ramp closer to the broader NSS operating margins over time. This contract is structured as a gain share contract which means there is a financial incentive for us to deliver ongoing cost reductions to the Ministry of Defense for the procurement and logistics solutions that we will deliver. These dynamics represent margin upside opportunities over the long term. And finally, please note this contract is denominated in pound sterling. And as such, we will have some level of currency exchange risk in our operating results going forward. As we develop greater visibility and precision on net cash flows related to this program, we will determine whether implementation of the currency hedging program is appropriate. Now on Health and Engineering or HES. HES revenues for Q1 calendar 2015 increased by $13 million or 3% year-over-year with growth driven by our engineering business. Q1 operating margins for the sector as reflected on slide 6 of our earnings presentation on our website include the impact of the previously disclosed $40 million Plainfield power plant impairment recorded in January 2015, as well as $6.4 million of operating losses from the plant during the quarter. When adjusting for these elements, Q1 operating margins for the sector was 10.2%. This represents a nearly 200-basis-point increase from the prior year period and is reflective of strong profitability performance of our security products business and the continued actions we have taken to rightsize the cost structure for other Health and Engineering elements particularly on the commercial health side. Due to the commercial and product aspects of our Health and Engineering sector, margins are more volatile and are significantly impacted by the timing of commercial health volumes and security product shipments. Just an update on the latter as we have talked about for a few quarters now, we had a large security products order in the Middle East but had not shipped products nor recorded revenue for various reasons. We recently satisfied all necessary conditions required to commence shipment and are making our initial shipment to the customer this month. Due to timing in contractual terms, we expect to recognize revenue from this shipment in Q3 rather than in Q2 as we originally had expected. During the first quarter, our corporate segment had a net cost of $17 million. This is a bit higher than our normative rate due to a combination of factors including facilities exit costs and legal costs which were incurred in January and also reflected in our Q4 fiscal 2015 results. The more normative annual run rate we expect for the corporate sector is in the $40 million to $45 million range. Now, moving on to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for calendar 2015 on all metrics. We continue to expect revenues in the range of $4.6 billion to $5.0 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.20 to $2.45 and cash flow from operations at or above $200 million. In conclusion, we're off to a good start in the year, and I'm encouraged by the improved climate in our end markets and most significantly by the contributions of our employees to position Leidos and our customers for future success. Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues and fellow gifted employees here at Leidos and also the investment community and our shareholders for all of your support in the near decade that I've been in this role. The greatest experience I will take away is seeing firsthand the power and impact that our dedicated employees have had on our customers and also our nation. That positive force allows me to depart with the utmost pride in our company and confidence that Leidos is only at the beginning of great things to come. With that operator, let's now open it up for questions.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much, and, Mark, job well done. So, a quick question on the LCST contract. I think you said that you have a $30 million upfront kind of cash flow need as you build inventory. If you're starting out with margins a bit below the sector average, is it that basically it's going to take you three years to basically earn that back or does that cash flow start to turn positive in the second year? Thanks.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Cai. First, it's Mark. Thank you for your earlier remark. I would say that the $30 million includes both inventory and receivables just to clarify that. And we have in our expectations a very favorable ROI for the program overall. The working capital consumption in years two and beyond is very low and attractive for us, and so we do expect a reversal, of course, and positive cash flows, maybe not in the second year but by the third or fourth, we expect to be in positive territory.\n",
      "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. And maybe you could give us an update on DHMSM.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, hey, great, Cai. Good morning. This is Roger. Let me just kind of bring you up to speed on where we are. So, DHMSM is the DHA electronic health records modernization program and fairly complex program that has gone through several phases. We have submitted – actually, I think yesterday what we would call our IPR which is another milestone in the program. So, we had prior submittals, we had questions, we've met with the customer and done orals. That has led us to updating our proposal, and submittal of this thing called an IPR. Now, the customer will evaluate the IPR, give us scoring against our technical offering and respond back. And that should happen, I would say, in weeks. And then, what will happen next is with that, they will ask for the final price revision or best and final offer, and we will go to final on the submittal we think four to six weeks from now with an award decision we think coming out in the July-August timeframe. So, it's been a long road, we think. We see a light at the end of the tunnel. And frankly, we're very pleased with where we find ourselves at this point.\n",
      "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. And one last one. Commercial health, could you give us some updates? I guess you said that the revenues were down. How much were they down? And basically is that business starting to show any signs of life on the order book?\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In terms of year-over-year, it was down double digits, Cai. But we see signs of stabilization. We have new members of the team, Roger referred to one that's coming on board shortly but others there and just came out of the very positive trade show experience with the team. And so it's good signals there. On the other hand, it still remains to be a low visibility business 60 days to 90 days of visibility. And that's why we need to be cautious in our outlook and move very methodically in our steps to expand our offerings in the solutions and records exploitation phase and revenue management and so forth and build the team.\n",
      "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. Congrats to Mark. Wondering if you are going to let your hair down now. Given that we seem to be moving forward with a 2016 federal budget that wants to use the OCO mechanism rather than raise the base budget, how is that impacting your client decision-making, given that they are back to looking at short-term funding and not a long-term visibility?\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Great question. Of course, we're all watching what's going on down the street in Washington. Even although the Congress seems to be asking for more money, it's not clear that the president is going to give them everything that they're looking for, and it would appear this year as in past, we may use OCO to make up the difference. First, and I would say, I think we have all sort of predicted this. So, this is not a new behavior. And to the extent it has affected customer behavior, that's a little bit baked into our projections already. But if you want a general answer, the general answer is people tend to be delaying and procurements tend to move to the right. However, I've been doing this a long time, and I could make that statement in both good times and bad that nothing ever happens quite on the schedule that the procurement official would like. But I'm a little bit more optimistic, frankly, this year than I may have been in prior years, but we're getting more dialogue between the Hill and the White House. And frankly, with Ash Carter, I think he's been a lot more proactive in spending time with the Hill and reaching out, trying to get those funding that he needs to run the Department of Defense.\n",
      "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Could you talk a little bit about pricing in the non-commodity part of your efforts? Is it easing up? Are the clients starting to pay for value or is pricing still pretty tight across the board?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Well, let's start with probably the most apparent dialogue and that is Frank Kendall and Better Buying Power 2.0 and 3.0. And it's clearly stated that he does not want to stretch his budget on the back of making this an attractive place for companies to compete. And so, the dialogue is there. We have seen – I think various program managers interpret that in different ways. I think rather than see overall pressure on profitability, we see different contract types. So where we might have seen firm fixed price, we now see fixed-price incentive. Where we would have seen more flexible pricing and development, we see more award fees. I think, again, with (29:59) and Frank, they're going to hold their industry's feet to the fire. But I think if you perform, you'd be able to achieve margins at historical levels. And we've done a great job of executing and our historical levels have been pretty steady.\n",
      "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: The Defense Department has sort of been asking the contractors to step up and fund some R&D for them. Where is Leidos in that view, their willingness to provide unfunded R&D?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Well, there's been some complex discussions around R&D and IR&D recovery with the customer. Let me answer your question first and then come back to some of the policy discussions that are going on. First, we're going to spend more on R&D this year than we spent in last. We are a technology oriented company and we think it's important to spend targeted IR&D – frankly CSR&D on the commercial side and we actually have some pretty innovative programs we're running out of our corporate office to encourage innovation in the line. We have sort of some very entrepreneurial monies that we spend to do very far-out R&D. The conversations we've had with DoD had been more around how does the department optimize the spend of the entire industry. And if you've been a student of the industry for a long time and I know that you have. We used to have a lot of oversight into how we spent our IR&D. We had to write something called IR&D recovery brochure, and we had to have a sponsor in the government. They essentially proactively managed the industry spend. We went from that to where whatever you could afford in your overhead you were allowed to spend and there was much less oversight from DoD on our R&D. I see the pendulum swinging back slightly to where Frank wants to optimize the amount of money that he spent industry-wide that's in G&A. We're not sure how that's going to manifest itself, and we're working with Frank directly and through industry organizations like AIA to make sure that's done in a thoughtful way. And that's all embodied in this Better Buying Power 3.0.\n",
      "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you, and all the best Mark.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Ed.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Raviv from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning. A follow-up question on the UK contracts. You talked about $225 million, below-average margins. When can we expect that to ramp? Is that kind of like we got a half year this year and then a full year next year, or believe it's slower or faster than that?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: What I'd like to do with that question and maybe to expand a little bit on what's going in the UK is to introduce Lou Von Thaer who is president of our National Security Solutions sector. Lou and his team have been working for years on this terrific win for Leidos and Lou is here with us and I would ask Lou just to answer more color on what's going on in revenue and profitability and a little bit about what we are going to do for the UK government.\n",
      "Lou Von Thaer - President, National Security Sector, Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, thank you Roger. And Jon thanks for the question. But let me start with a little bit on the contract itself because it's a very interesting contract for us, and it's one that we're extremely proud of our team and extremely proud to be part of. This contract will really transform the MOD's entire material stores management and distribution networks. It's not the implementation of simply one system or staff augmentation, or putting oil cans and tires on shelves. It's the beginning of an enterprise-wide transformation for parts of the MOD. The scope of the engagement encompasses information systems, business process optimization, streamlining and optimization of storage and distribution networks, enhancing and optimizing the demand planning and forecasting systems that the MOD will use for all their forward deployed services. There's a lot of science to this and we're very pleased that the customer has entrusted us to deliver the solution for them, as we've done in past engagements with the U.S. DoD and NATO. Really proud of the team. We've been working on this and we've had dozens of people from across the company doing 14-hour days for the last couple of years. And to be fair, MOD team has done the same level of work on this and the same level of dedication. And I think it's been a great partnership. We're very happy to come through the competition. And it's impossible to ever recognize all the people who contribute to something like this. But I do want to call out a few of our key people that deserves special notoriety: Michael White, Scott Handley were our business development or business manager and contracts leads; Mitch Stevenson was our Deputy of the Contract; and Barb Doornink was our Senior Vice President and now our Managing Director, who is actually staying in-country for the next several years to work this. So, this is a 13-year contract, 3-year transition, 10-year operation after that. And there's actually an option for an additional two years at the end of that potentially, if they decide to go to a re-compete and go to the next stages. So, if we look at how the contract starts up, this year, we expect some phenomenal revenues. We expect it to build relatively quickly next year into that $225 million, maybe even a little bit higher range that Mark spoke to. And the margins we expect will start lower, but by the end of the transition, we should be starting to approach to that three-year transition. We should be getting in the range of the typical earnings rates for the NSS sector as we look. And as we look at this, we already see the customer starting to talk about potential add-ons to the contracts. So, we'll play those out over time as we get up and start to execute. I think they're hoping to use this as a model for how other parts of MOD could take advantage of this contract and this actual application of systems. So, time will tell. We have a lot of hard work to do. But the team's off and running very well. As Mark mentioned, we signed the contract, and we expect over – hopefully this quarter but certainly by third quarter to have the final contracts precedence completed. Those are actually in place because the original intent was to award the contract before Christmas and then have it in place to operate when the award slipped out. Both sides wanted to make up as much time as possible to get the contract up and running as soon as possible. So, because of that, there's a few actions on both our side and the MOD side to complete a few of the contract actions. And those are well under way. We don't see any of those as significant issues.\n",
      "Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks for that extensive answer. Lou, while I have you, you talk about normative NSS or typical NSS margins. What is that really, in your mind? I know we're under pressure this year. But is this a 7.5% business, an 8% business? Have you ever thought about a number there?\n",
      "Lou Von Thaer - President, National Security Sector, Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Oh, I think about it all the time. I think as Mark said earlier, we've certainly seen some facility and other costs that have kind of taken from that. But typically, we're in the 8% range. We've said that before. I think when we pull out all the pieces, we continue to operate around that range. And we really don't see anything in the portfolio that would change that substantially over the next few years.\n",
      "Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Can you stay in the 8%s even as LCST ramps?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think so.\n",
      "Lou Von Thaer - President, National Security Sector, Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I think in the first year, there won't be – the sales probably won't have a material impact. And in the second year, again, around 8%, we may see a few basis points up or down time to time. But I don't see a marginal change.\n",
      "Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Loomis from Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you and good luck, Mark, with your next ventures.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you very much, Bill.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just looking at the margins on the commercial healthcare within Health and Engineering, what is that? How much did the product sales boost margins to the adjusted 10%? I'm just trying to get a sense of what that volatility might be with the product sales versus a sustainable commercial healthcare margin.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The first – Bill, again, thanks for the comment. We don't like to give too much detail on the components of the sectors from profitability perspective. I would like to go back and expand on my remark on commercial health earlier. While it did have meaningful revenue declines, I tip my hat to the team, they are profitable. In Q1, meaningful level, not up to the full margin level of the company, but still respectable and they've done a good job managing cost to achieve that. And I'll just reiterate that as you know, when we have meaningful product deliveries out of our security products business, it is our highest margin business in the company. And they've done a wonderful job for many years balancing their products and their maintenance streams to produce among the more attractive returns in that space. And we expect that to continue as they have meaningful volumes quarter-to-quarter, and that's why there is the type of volatility we saw on the first quarter being very strong. Other quarters will depend on the security product shipment levels and the overall level of business across our commercial space to include commercial engineering and health.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, just on the Middle East product sales that you expect to recognize in third quarter, is that a very high margin? And given the size are we going to see a margin – an adjusted margin greater than 10% in the second half?\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'm not going to predict what our precise margin is going to be in the third quarter, but I think that because of the push there will be a little bit of stress in the second quarter from a margin perspective for the contribution that we will or we hope to see from security products that will be pushed to the right. So, bear that in mind. But for the same reason Q3 should be relatively strong assuming that revenue recognition does occur in that period of time. Dealing with international shipments and installations and ultimate acceptance, there is some risk to that. But that's our current estimate is to hit that in Q3 and I would say that this particular order with this Middle East customer is at a profit level similar to the rest of our security products business.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Then just a final question on the UK contract. Can you talk a little bit about the labor transfer that have occurred or will occur? And is there any restrictions on that? Like do you have union agreements, or do you have flexibility on workforce adjustments, or are your hands tied. If you could just go through that a little more? Thanks.\n",
      "Lou Von Thaer - President, National Security Sector, Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So, this is Lou again. So, we have the TUPE process in the UK that kind of regulates and determines how these items are happening and the abilities that people have. So we did a couple of things. One is we partnered with Kuehne + Nagel, a large logistics firm, worldwide firm that's been a terrific partner on this. And what we have done is Leidos will take over some of these employees, Kuehne + Nagel will take over many of them who are doing a lot of the distribution, truck driving, forklifts, things like that. And we will use what flexibilities we do have within the contract. The MOD expects the size of the workforce to come down over time as we add efficiencies. But by partnering with a large UK firm who has hundreds of job openings around the country for commercial versions of the same types of services, we believe the training programs we're putting in place and the flexibility they have with job openings will allow places for people to land as we add efficiencies to the contract and also to help the folks from the government side become trained in some commercial techniques in addition to the skills they already bring to the program.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So are you tied into some type of wage agreement or labor type – similar type of union agreement, for example, like we have in – like there might be in the U.S. in some circumstances?\n",
      "Lou Von Thaer - President, National Security Sector, Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean. There are the MOD – or the government rules across the UK and we are tied into those. Those are all factored into the bid that we put forward and within those rule sets are where we plan to add the efficiencies that we'll add over time.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just be clear on pass-throughs and commodities, so you are not – none of the equipment you're putting through is going to go through your revenues. That is why the margin on this program you're talking about is going to be – once it ramps up, is going to be similar to the NSS normalized margins. Is that correct? It's just going to be more just direct labor?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Exactly. That's our plan. And as Mark stated, we plan to use net accounting and through the ability that we're able to do that. That's exactly how we'll book the program.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bill.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael French from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Michael Kendrick French - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\n",
      "Michael Kendrick French - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Roger, you did mention on your portfolio shaping that you haven't made any decisions. The question would be, if you could please add a little color on the factors that are being evaluated and what we might anticipate in terms of the timing of any decisions.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. It's not a very exciting process. We're thinking about who the best natural owner is for the businesses that we have in light of where want to go from a strategy standpoint. And it became clear that Plainfield that we were not the best natural owner for a renewable power plant and it was a – not a difficult decision for the team nine months ago or so. CloudShield sort of ended up in the same mode very kind of hardware-driven product that we didn't think aligned with where we wanted to go. And I don't want to overstate that work that we're doing. We just want to make sure that we have a consistent strategy and the businesses that we have in our portfolio align with that strategy.\n",
      "Michael Kendrick French - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Okay. And I suppose the flip side on the portfolio shaping would be potential acquisitions. As I am sure you are very well aware, the marketplace has been heating up in this space recently. Wondering what your thoughts are on possibility of perhaps an acquisition.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We've touched on this in prior calls. Let me just kind of reiterate our thinking in our process. But first, obviously, we do recognize that there has been a considerable amount of activity in the mid-tier space and in the services sector. The deals that had happened, I think everyone has taken a look at. One would draw from that that we have as well, and we are not disappointed that those deals went to another company again. We're being very careful about our strategy and where we want to position the company. We currently have the ability to play in the marketplace, and we have a group and a pipeline, and we're looking at all of these opportunities, but as I said in the past I think we're being very thoughtful about where we're going to deploy our capital. And it would have to be a business that created considerable cross linkages into our business and the pricing would have to be right. Now is not the time for us to lose our discipline given that we have an enviable balance sheet position.\n",
      "Michael Kendrick French - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Okay, very well. Finally, I would just like to conclude my questions by just offering a comment. Mark, I would like to thank you for all your help and extend my best wishes for you in your future endeavors. Thanks again.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Michael, very much.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC: Hi, this is Amit Singh for Jason. Just quickly on the guidance, now that one quarter for the year is behind us and there are still a couple of moving parts in the whole year. So I just wanted to get a sense of, as you've provided or reiterated your guidance, how much visibility do you have towards the lower end of the revenue guidance right now?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Let me make sure I understand the question. I think your question how much visibility do we have towards the lower end of our guidance.\n",
      "Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. Revenue guidance.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'm sure as you heard Mark reaffirmed the guidance that we had out at the beginning of the year. So, our revenue guidance is $4.6 billion to $5.0 billion. And I think sort of what you're asking is how do we feel about our risk and opportunities given the guidance that we have out there, and I'll make a statement. I'll turn it over to Mike or to Mark excuse me. I mean clearly we have reaffirmed our guidance based upon the visibility that we have in the year given that we just closed the first quarter. So, we must feel pretty comfortable with the balance between our risk and opportunities and the guidance that we have outstanding. Mark if you want to add any color.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Amit, I'll just say that we have some upside opportunities, and we have some risks. But we think on balance even given a fair share of each of those, we can be in our range and comfortably in our range. And so I'd say we have good visibility and confidence clearly on the lower end and above that coming out of a strong quarter. We do have some security products that are backend weighted. Some of those are international. Those represent some degree of risk although we have a great team there. We've mentioned the visibility issues on our commercial health. We had confidence in the new team we have there, and then we have Plainfield which we do expect to sell. We factored that in for half of the year with operating losses. If that shifts to the right then that could apply a little bit of pressure there. And I'd say major upside is getting LCST off the ground not to the guidance, but to offset those possible risks to balance things out. So, we think we have a strong portfolio and we're off to a good start, so we're confident we'll hit the expectation.\n",
      "Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC: All right, perfect. Then in the prepared remarks you spoke about dividends being your top priority for capital deployment; and then you just talked about your M&A strategy. But where does share buyback fall into all of this? And what is your thinking about share buyback or any accelerated share buyback in near-term as you're (49:41) if you're looking for any opportunity or strong cash flow?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Right. Well, okay. So, share buyback is a tool that we have used in the past. We still have about 8 million shares authorized by the board. It is in that category of returning value to the shareholders and it's something that we consider every quarter as we think about our cash deployment.\n",
      "Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\n",
      "Kelly P. Hernandez - Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay. Thank you, all, so much for joining us today on the call. Thank you for your interest in the company. We look forward to updating you again next quarter. Thanks.\n",
      "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect.\n"

      "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the ManTech International Corp. First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Stuart Davis, Executive Vice President for Strategy. Sir, you may begin.\n",
      "Stuart Davis: Thank you, Amanda, and welcome, everyone. On today's call, we have George Pedersen, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Phillips, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Bill Varner and Dan Keefe, our two Group Presidents. During this call, we will make statements that do not address historical facts and thus are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.These forward-looking statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. For a full discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in our latest Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements made on this call. Now, I'd like to turn things over to George.\n",
      "George Pedersen: Good afternoon and thank you for participating in today's call. For the first quarter, ManTech showed strong margin driven by stability and direct labor and lower indirect expenses. We experienced some reduction in revenue which was the result of pullback and sub-contracts and materials primarily that was used in Afghanistan. The in-theatre staffing today is about 300 people compared to 2400 in early 2013. In addition we had excellent cash generation with operating cash flow more than doubled net income. Our ability to generate cash enables us to invest in the growth of the company. On that note earlier this week we acquired Welkin Associates which strengthens our ability to provide high end systems engineering and business solution especially in intelligence community. Welkin is the next organization to ManTech and we are actively looking for other promising acquisition candidates. The 44 million in cash and net cash and then $500 million line of credit we have cash and the balance sheet to acquire more and larger firms and we will refine the appropriate ones. The current industry dynamics support our acquisition plans given the greatest certainty around funding, we are seeing more high quality companies of all sizes become available for acquisition. In addition to full appropriation for the fiscal year 2015, there appears to be more normal appropriation, a more normal appropriation classes to 2016. The budget resolution pass and both the house of the senate. It is encouraging to see both houses of the Congress are looking for ways to increase defense spending whether to increase OCO funding that's overseas funding or sequester relief. We see funding in fact we see the funding environment as a very positive for the industry and for ManTech. Now Kevin will provide you details on our financial performance and outlook. Kevin?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Thank you George. Revenues for the first quarter were 370 million compared to 452 million in the first quarter of last year and 411 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The year over year revenue difference are mostly explained by clients in the Afghanistan related contracts and pressure is on the overall army budget. Revenues for the quarter were below last quarter as a result of two factors, first we experienced reduced sub-contract material requirements primarily from the army and OCO related demand. Annualized direct labor which is central to our value proposition as a services company was up compared to the fourth quarter after adjusting for two fewer workdays. Second, projected new contract awards did not materialized almost 2 billion of awards expected in the first half of this year have slipped to the right causing delays in the work. Our support for OCO contributed 23 million which is down 8 million from the first quarter. We still expect the OCO related work contributed about 75 million for the year. There is a little change in the standard revenue breakouts that we report. Prime contractor mix remained at 89% of revenue, 68% of first quarter revenues were on cost plus contracts, 11% were on time of material contracts and 21% were on fixed price contracts. Operating income for the quarter of 20 million was essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2014. Quarterly operating margin of 5.4 million increased a 100 basis points year-over-year, as a result of the direct labor mix, strong contract performance and improved cost management. General and administrative expenses dropped 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Net income was 12 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.31 for the quarter which were up 23% and 19% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2014. Net income and earnings per share benefitted from margin expansion as well as reduced interest expenses from redeeming senior notes of the second quarter of 2014. Onto the balance sheet and cash flow statement, during the quarter, cash flows from operations were 26 million or 2.2 times net income. DSOs were 87 days for the quarter which reflects the temporary increase as we upgraded the company’s financial management system. DSOs to come back down as we complete this transition. Our balance sheet at quarter end shows 44 million in cash and no debt after playing 7.9 million in dividend. Our balance sheet provides plenty of fire power for acquisitions such as the Welkin acquisition we just closed. The $34 million payment which we're able to fund from cash on hand will be reflected on our second quarter financials. Welkin contribute sold growth in operating margins and be accretive to earnings per share in 2015. Turning to business development, bookings for the quarter were $149 million for a book-to-bill of 0.4% times. As a result backlog at the end of the quarter stood at 3 billion of which 900 million was funded. Approximately 44% of awards were for new business, primarily in the areas of health, software support, and systems engineering. We also won $44 million contract in the quarter that was subsequently proto-testing. We continue to be optimistic at a significant number of proposal debt outstanding will be awarded during 2015. At the end of the quarter we had a total qualified pipeline of 21 billion of which 5 billion was outstanding and waiting - the total pipeline is over weighted for cyber, intelligence and health for those areas adding over 2 million in qualified opportunities over the last six months. Since the last call we have identified 2 billion in additional proposals that we expect to submit in 2015 for a total of nearly $9 billion. This will be about 2 billion more than last year which was more than doubled the volume of 2013 and a record for us excluding the overseas activity. Despite delays in protest the market is said to rebound and revenues will accelerate as we win work from substantial pipeline of submitted proposals or near-term opportunity. Now that the - we expect to revenues of 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion net income of 53.7, to 57.9 and diluted per share of a $1.43 or $1.54. The guidance reduction reflects slower than anticipated workflow and lower materials in sub-contracted volumes than previously expected. We have five proposal activity with continued uncertainty around the timing and outcome of award decisions. As a result we believe the guidance ranges are most appropriate at this point. Our revised revenue guidance assumes about 100 million of new business with future acquisitions. We believe this is reasonable given our substantial pipeline strong balance sheet and market environment that is turning more favorable. If customers stick their announced adjudication schedule which will be closer to the upper end to that range. On the bottom-line revised guidance shows an improved margin outlook from labor mix and lower G&A expense. Operating margin for the year should ended about 5.7%. Expectations or other items such as tax, rate and operating cash flow remain unchanged. Now Bill speak to our cyber and Intel business. Bill?\n",
      "Bill Varner: Thanks, Kevin and I am extremely pleased to welcome the highly skilled employees of Welkin to ManTech and to MCIS. They bring deep experience and demonstrated expertise and virtually all of them are directly supporting intelligence missions and are cleared at the highest level. Welkin deliveries mission centric services in high end systems engineering and advance national security technology and business services. Welkin's contributions to its customers are notable for their technical depth and for their criticality to mission execution. Their primary customer is the National Reconnaissance Office where they have performed work in nearly every directors in office supported dozens of major system acquisitions and aided in the operations of dozens more. In addition Welkin supports the number of other key customers both within the intelligence community and across the Department of Defense. Welkin's expertise is consistently sought by both customers and teaming partners. This acquisition is strategically positions us to pursue large engineering and support activities in the intelligence community and the Department of Defense. Together we are focused on the seamless transition of existing work and aggressive pursuit of new business. In other news I spent last week at the RSA conference which is the world's largest information security event. My discussions with existing and potential customers and partners highlighted the need for our cyber security services and product. The conference also showcased the momentum we are seeing on the commercial product side as we've rolled out the Linux addition of Responder Pro which analyzes physical memory from servers and hosts and enables deep forensic analysis of now artifacts in memory. Our product addressed the gap in today's market currently filled with signature and indicators of compromised based security products which are limited in their effectiveness and unable to defend against sophisticated event resistant threat. Our patented approach performed behavior based analysis of physical memory to detect malicious processes. With 200 plus customers and ManTech's deep cyber security experience in the Federal Government we delivered differentiated value and are poised for growth. In our services business, our customers are actively engaged and moving procurements alone. Many are still experiencing delays but we are seeing promising signs that our intelligence community customers will be making significant awards over the next several quarters. Our position in cyber should benefit from legislation that is currently working through Congress. After a series of false starts it appears that we will finally get cyber legislation that would push company to share access to their computer networks and records with federal investigators. Last week the house passed two bill that are similar to a measure approved by the senate intelligence committee. There are still some issues around the balance between privacy and liability protection but I'm hopeful that legislation will be enacted this year. Dan?\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Good afternoon. Like Bill I have just returned from major conference highlighting one of our key growth initiatives. Earlier this month they attended the health information and management system society or HIMS conference in Chicago. This event was massive and underscore how robust the health market will be for years to come. The conference also serves a launch of our ManTech health brand. Over the past three years we have invested in three acquisitions to build our capability and customer presence in health IT. Now we are aggressively investing and building out the leadership team to sustain and accelerate our growth. Our new leadership with Steve Comber, our new General Manager we've just hired three stellar executive that bring ManTech's health tremendous credibility and thought leadership. John Dorman joins us as Chief Information Officer responsible for the development of ManTech Health IT solution strategy and technology focused services to improve healthcare outcome. Dr. Bryan now leads our health and human services business and Dr. Carl Brazen [ph] will start next week as our Chief Medical Officer. All three are nationally recognized experts who have demonstrated ability to managing grow large federal health businesses. ManTech health will be a significant growth driver for MSS and ManTech. Turning to other parts of our business as Kevin indicated, we have stability in our OCO work. Over the last quarter we have received plus ups on some in-theatre work to maintain current levels of support. We do not see further downsize to our in-theatre business which provides us a stable platform for which to grow additional foreign military sales. However our business overseas is very much dependent on political decisions. George?\n",
      "George Pedersen: In summary, ManTech is moving out aggressively on acquisitions and new proposal submissions as we await awards from our large pipeline of submitted proposals. We are seeing a number of high quality companies coming to market and Welkin is the first of what we hope to be several additional acquisitions in 2015 and I started by the volume of opportunities that Bill and Dan are pursuing very high priority mission. In closing, I want to highlight to two region, accommodation speaks to the commitment and dedication of our employees and the work environment at ManTech. President Obama recognized ManTech employee with the Energy Lifestyle Award for developing a pioneer training program to health transition military residents to the clean energy workforce. In addition to military times recently rank ManTech is one of the best employees - we greatly value the contributions of our veterans, veterans have made and we're proud that so many of them are making another clear for themselves at ManTech. With that we are ready to take your questions.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good evening. It’s Rick on for Ed. Thank you for taking my question. The first one George you talked a lot of about M&A I was just curious sort of the size of the transactions you are looking or maybe the size of the transactions that we are comfortable with and whether you have seen larger properties now in the pipeline.\n",
      "George Pedersen: We have seen larger properties and I must say the volume of candidates that we are interested has increased in the past few months. For a period of time yeah, it was a little dry but it is turning around. And I will let Bill talk a little more about the acquisition that we have made but that is a good profile of what we are looking for. Talk a moment about why we picked what we did.\n",
      "Bill Varner: I will be happy to, thank you George. So the Welkin Associates acquisition is a represents opportunities for us in customer spaces that we know very well but market that are adjacent to where we are currently performing so, it provides us some opportunities to some current some large upcoming procurement where leader company could earn themselves but together we are able to and they offers us I think great expansion opportunities in areas where we are very interest in moving.\n",
      "George Pedersen: And again from the acquisition point of view we just reported our cash position. It is unusual for us over the years that have been - but we have been in that position for a while but we will continue to look aggressively for the companies large and small we will not by sales we must get new technology, new customers, new people and we have to be able to make a clear that is our policy in--\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Also just one the last point I believe you said Welkin would be accreted to 2015 EPS I am curious if you can give the expected run rate for revenue or maybe what the 2014 revenue was?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yeah, so 2014 revenue is about $33 million and the run-rate slightly above that on the day of acquisition and we will see growth from that going forward.\n",
      "George Pedersen: On that sales alone the combination.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just a last question for me you talked about seeing some awards not materializing things slipping to the right. I know that has been the trend for a while now from the space but curious what the recent behavior going to client it has been different and why do you think those in particular slot? Thank you.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yeah, so there is a lot of volume in customer and I'll let Dan and Bill add to it. There are a lot of customers working procurements I think the slots are mixed based on the customer but generally they have the money they are going to make awards which is different than two years think they're being very cautious about reviewing everything and making sure that it's a reasonable decisions on their behalf and then in some cases I think different agencies are still going through internal reviews as to prioritization. But we see a lot of volumes, we see a lot of opportunities we're very focused on that and I think it's more internal timing within the customer. Guys do you want to add anything? A - Bill Varner And in some cases in the intelligence community we see that there are just aren’t people in the acquisition workforce and therefore the review of proposal takes time and the awarding the proposals takes more than then it should.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.\n",
      "Steven Cahall: Yeah, thanks very much. Maybe just a first question on revenue and growth just you know looking for range and guidance for the year and maybe excluding the OTO work is it reasonable for us to expect you maybe exit the year with flat or even slightly growing revenues were based on the instability which you're still seeing would that be able to too optimistic at this point.\n",
      "Unidentified Corporate Speaker: So I mean that the timing of growth is very much depend on the contract award volume which we have not submits out there we do expect all things moving in the right direction in Q4 this year that will start seeing in the growth and we do expect that to the year based on the volume of activity that will start seeing a growth patter again.\n",
      "Steven Cahall: Okay and then maybe just to follow up the M&A theme. Maybe a couple of questions here. So George you mentioned that Welkin is a good example of some stuff you're seeing maybe - seeing that you could do a lot of things at the size of Welkin and still have a lot of cash left. Is there an appetite to do anything outside of the dividend or M&A or are we saving all of the cash for M&A in terms of priorities at this point.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Hey Kevin I'll speak with that. As we've been fairly consistent with the acquisitions is our number one priority. Dividend policy we firmly have a second. If we don't have any use of cash after looking at properties which I think are number out there that I just toward set are becoming more active and we look at other alternatives and we have discussion around that to make decisions. But the acquisitions continues to be our number one priority for use of cash.\n",
      "Steven Cahall: And then a final one from me and then I'll get off. When you talk about the M&A pipeline picking up and the interest picking up with the stabilization in the market. Does the same thing happen where all this said now you are getting interest as a target as well do you see that level of activity in the market or have that would be buyers of companies really not guiding that comfortable with the situation as yet.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: I think that the companies have to focus on that as a strategy and then they're being more open about that based upon the market be rather than more strategic discussions like that. That's our view.\n",
      "Steven Cahall: Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Thank you I wanted to start with how many proposals are waiting awards into the March quarter.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: We have $5 billion proposals in process or are waiting award.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Okay and then from that I guess I understand there were delays. But as I look back to a very few quarters where you had this much just a little business from new awards. You had a few in '14 and in previous years I mean '13, '12 or if something like the $60 million to $65 million contract renewal awards or new revenue. Right so I guess I'm wondering if that’s a function of delay is getting worse. Are you is your win rate a little bit lower than in the past does it may be curious where you think behind the weaker bookings is opposed to the stronger bookings of course not March of last year which was one of the weakest quarters you ever had.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yeah so just couple of observations. For the announced proposals that we're going after a vast majority at 80% range of new work and that is going to be harder to get win rates or wins. And so that I guess in average historic the win rate is going to be less. But if we get those contract awards from the upside is significant. So we're very much focused on that that we compete levels this year below average and that the timing is to get depends on the customer set but generally we see more activity but more cost as review cycle to get to the award. And I think that they will begin to award is just the timing issue.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Okay hearing on the hill is that this current plans increase the defense budget by $38 billion for next year that is in a formal proposal at this point in time. But that's the current beliefs that that's how the appropriation process will wind up by adding $38 billion\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Now I know in April you would expected a few very large award which in second quarter to be adjudicated hoping that you'd be the victor as that's new business couple of large intel ones. Where those further delayed or has April started off the same way the first quarter started.\n",
      "Bill Varner: Well Brian this is Bill one of those large activities was mine and I'm sorry to have to say that unfortunately we were not awarded best large - despite providing a very compelling technical and management solutions. However we still have many large opportunities left within the intelligence community that we are either currently writing proposals awaiting award or in some phase of capture.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: We were not be - on that particular program so it doesn't represent the decline in our revenue. And there is still maybe opportunities for sub-contracts.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: But why committed all on that I think there one there was inconvenient and a multi 100 million to a billion dollar award is that one?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yes, Brian there was inconvenient.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Okay. And I guess I have one more question on the bigger picture of guidance I mean it is not just guys the industries had a difficult meeting as we have seen some contracting go down we have seen hardware or material purchases go down and we have seen protest and you mentioned in your guidance basically include a 100 million that you need to win or acquire first of all that is the low end of the midpoint but secondly given the pace of our words right now coupled with the protest usually will make you take a long time before you actually generate revenue is that really reasonable? I mean is that a difficult target of 100 million do you think that is challenging target I am just curious how you look at that?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: So when we look at the amount of new business award for going after and the 5 billion is actually actionable and I would mention the industry the biggest judge - if you have that amount of activities from the government you think you are well positioned how do you incorporate that into your view of the business and how much delayed you have built to the timing of the awards and we have time to come more focus on that timing and trying to build that in but I would say it is hitting this but we fit more than a share then we work then it goes above that and if not then we continue to wait for those awards to happen. The $100 million is the midpoint and again I think that we are well positioned based on the investments we have made over the last year and half if you start new business awards into that expansion.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: One last one, the second quarter revenue given the new awards not to recomplete we are fairly low it be similar looking to March quarter plus maybe the acquisition revenue that you have I mean there shouldn’t be a steep ramping like you are saying the second-half of the year hopefully will be much stronger given congress it was then how we should think about it?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It will be higher there are more billable mandates in second quarter then first, first quarter is a low spill of the mandate at the total year and we do expect some of the ODCs not all but some of the ODCs that did not occur inQ1 come back up because it is more of a timing issue and then in Dan’s - pace to start getting more new contract awards and in fact the first month’s contract award is already at or above our full prior quarter award subject to protest. So we --some another.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Great, thank you.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: And Brian we do expect Q3 to above Q2 and Q4 to above than Q3.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Got it, thanks very much.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Loomis from Stifel. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Okay, thank you. On the OCO revenue I heard 75 million for the year but what was for the quarter and first quarter?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: 23 million.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Okay. And then on 100 million of awards you mean but that include potential acquired companies or is that just new organic bids?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It is a mix if we have a bids that get awarded we can see getting to the upside of our range with that $100 million and then if not then we have an inquisitor process that could help us get there if the contract awards don’t happen. So we build them all them together but we do think there is not contract award activity to support the range that we have to be the primary driver.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Okay. And then on the commercial cyber Bill you talked about your new products 200 customer. What is the run rate on that now and is the commercial cyber profitable?\n",
      "Bill Varner: Commercial cyber is not yet profitable and that we are still investing in the business. We do have 200 commercial customers we have also several government commercial customers or the commercial products these are products that can be sold either to the government or to others in the industry is that what you are asking Bill?\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Yes, then anyway you can size what is the revenue run rate is now in commercial cyber?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It is Kevin it is consistent with prior but the level of investment is less we are actually closer to break even not breaking closer to than a year a fairly consistent top-line number.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: And if I have look back to nose was that 5 million in the quarter than in the past?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It was full year between $5 million and $10 million okay. And then on the OCO revenues to stabilizing and you have a good visibility on that $75 million. What happened as we extent 9000 troops for another year? Do you think you could actually see some potential growth in that or do you is this kind of the floor number?\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Yeah this is Dan as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we did see additional funding and that really to for the government recognized that the ramp down of their plan was not going to occur as they had planned it. So I don't see additional growth again that's all time the political decisions obviously. But I think what we're seeing is fairly stable given the national guidance for 2015 pretty stable for this year.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Okay. And then the margin on that OCO business is that still to only 4% or 5% type business.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: It's below that it's below under the range that we have for returns.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Okay thank you.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Good afternoon.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Hello.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Hi, I guess I have a couple of questions which related to the revenue guidance just like others before me. Before we get to that one question what was your organic sales growth in the quarter and what's embedded for the year.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: For the quarter organic decline of 23% and for the full year midpoint the organic would be around 9%.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Okay about 9%. And then on the --.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Negative sorry yes.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Minus 9. I'm hearing what you're seeing about the pipeline. But at the same time I can't help at noticed that your funded backlog is added just relative low here at around $900 million total backlog as well. And at the midpoint of your guidance which of course includes it sounds like some business you have in one. The implied quarterly revenue is a good $50 million above what it was in the first quarter. And so I'm just struggling to see how we don't continue to see how we get to the guidance number the revenue number. Because when we knock off the $100 million we knock off the three quarter contribution from the acquisitions. I guess you should be somewhere in the $1.5 billion range. So it's not clear to me quite how you get there how you have the confidence to get there.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Okay. So in the first quarter if you think about the revenues that we have there. About half of that roughly $20 million of that is related to OCO drops or mandate differences the mandate differences will come back up. And the other half were on the ODCs that we do believe based on the visibility that will come back at some level let's say $10 million. So roughly $20 million on top of the three 370 gets us moving in the right direction. We do have contract awards are starting to get. And the $900 million we have in funded backlog is fairly consistent with last year. And the majority of the work that we're bidding on is new. So we do think that if we start getting contract awards it will be new business this will start ramping up and should get us to the guidance range that we’ve provided.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Would you say Kevin that you've changed maybe this question for George as well? You’ve changed your forecasting process at all through over the past several quarters given the challenge to meet projections?\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Yes I think we have changed that we've also tried to work towards the range based on what we have. So, we are trying to modify what we are providing moving to the ranges looking at what we have based on just the variability of having –so many proposals outstanding, but the timing of the awards being uncertain.\n",
      "George Pedersen: We are trying to tie the current status to the appropriation process. It's frustrating to have so many proposals submitted and awaiting award and they're not coming to the system. And it's hopeful that we hope at this point in time that this additional funding and the additional staffing will accelerate that process.\n",
      "Stuart Davis: This is Stuart we're also trying to be very transparent about what we need to hit that guidance.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: I think you are being as transparent as you can be but it is just been a trend here where somehow the numbers have been somewhat consistently optimistic, relatively to what’s come through and I am just wondering if there is any kind of systemic explanation.\n",
      "George Pedersen: It's based on the timing of awards and if we are being [indiscernible] about the new business getting our fair share of it and that would be our downside.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Hey good evening guys.\n",
      "George Pedersen: Hey.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Maybe I missed this but could you articulate Welkin’s contribution to the sales this year and to earnings?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: So the earnings are small given the size of the deal, it's a $33 million revenue business in 2014, we expect it to, from the date of contract award for to be at or above that run rate, totally in the mid-20s to the low 20s in terms of contribution --.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Alright and you said its de minimus earnings maybe $0.01 or $0.02?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yes.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Okay and then you mentioned I think Kevin that early in the second quarter you have had a pretty good contract award pace and I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that. How does it?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It's more normalized to where we want to be, I wouldn’t say it's robust but it's moving in the right direction.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Okay and to hit… I mean just go back to this question on the sales guidance, specifically how much go-get do you still have and do you need to book to hit the numbers, to hit the low end and maybe to hit the high end?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: So the $100 million is the revenue contribution we need from new business awards and the go get totally depends on what the time of those contract awards are. So if we have $5 billion or $8 billion we expect to be awarded over the next 12 months, the timing of those awards and how much we get is what’s going to drive that.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Okay. Just to be clear on those stuff, that’s a 100 million of awards from today, so not including what you’ve already won in the quarter?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Correct, $100 million.\n",
      "George Pedersen: $100 million in revenue that’s driven by new awards at the midpoint of the guidance.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Got it, of revenue so the award will have to be much higher presumably.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yes.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: And could you comment on with respect to what you are bidding on, does it come with a lot of sub contract and/or ODC works so that I imagine it would be very difficult to hire and ask people to convert 100 million of direct billable labor into sales in the year, or not? I mean if you could just… Are there any chunky bids that you are pursuing, are you doing a lot of ODCs with them?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It's mainly services based and there will be mix of ManTech labor and sub contract labor. There are some ODCs but as not as heavily weighted or merely as heavily weighted as it was in the past.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Okay, in the 100 million you have talked about, is that to get to the low end of the range, or is that the midpoint of the range?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: That’s where we have what we have as midpoint.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.\n",
      "Operator: [Operators Instructions] Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Thanks I was wondering if you could talk about the healthcare end market and what you are seeing there both on the government side in any kind of commercial prospects you may have? Thank you.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Yes, this is Dan. I mean clearly within the government health market, which is where our focus area is, there is tremendous effort going on the government to standardize the electronic health records and that’s what we do, both in data analysis, cloud based health records, so you see that in all the agencies, the DoD Defense health agency, NVA and Health of Human Services. So that’s really where the large growth within that business that we see, commercially limited right now.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Right, switching gears just one kind of tech question, the temporary pick up in DSO pardon us if you mentioned this, because I did juggle on the couple of calls, has that righted itself so far in 2Q or do you expect it too soon?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yes, we expect it to write itself it's a conversion issue we upgrade our system, our financial system, it’ll correct itself over the quarter.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Okay, so from your perspective just the temporary blip almost behind us.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yes.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Okay. From a balance sheet perspective I understand you were pretty constructive on M&A opportunities are there any other plans to return capital to shareholders, kind of above and beyond the dividend that you have got and the capital structure perhaps could be enhanced? Thanks.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Sure. Right now we still have to use cash primarily for acquisitions, as they review the dividend policy every quarter, at this point in time we are maintained at our current dividend level. But if we don’t see any path for acquisition that are adventurous to us, it will go back to yard again.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Is there any kind of longer term capital structure goal that you would have in mind I understand it can be kind of chunky and you can oscillate around it depending on acquisitions you may consummate but…\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: I think what we have found is that… the dividend distribution that we have seems to fit within our operating cash flow the desire of we want to maintain additional acquisitions I don’t see that profile changing in the near future.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Okay. Thank you very much.\n",
      "George Pedersen: Amanda it appears that we have no more questions in the queue at this time. I appreciate your help on the call. As usual members of the team will be here available for follow-up questions. So I thank you all for your participation on today’s call and your interest in ManTech.\n",
      "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.\n"

I’d now like to turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen:  Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco’s second quarter results for fiscal year 2012 and the press release issued earlier this morning.  With me today are Tyco’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen; and Tyco’s Chief Financial Officer, Frank Sklarsky. Also joining us for today’s conference call are the President’s of Fire and Security, ADT and Flow Control. George Oliver, Naren Gursahaney, and Patrick Decker, who will provide updates on their businesses and also participate in the Q&A sessions following our remarks.  I would like to remind you that during the course of today’s call we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today’s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we’ve included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC Form 10-Q later today. Certain items to be discussed during today’s call, including those related to the company’s proposed separation, will be addressed in a proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Before making any voting decisions, investors are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the proposed separation and any other relevant documents carefully in their entirety as they become available, because they will contain important information about the proposed separation.  Free copies of the proxy statement when available and other documents filed with the SEC by Tyco can be obtained through the SEC’s website, as well as through Tyco’s website. I would also like to remind you that we recently filed a Form 10 registration statement related to the ADT Corporation and posted a slide deck related to the Form 10 to our website. We also intend to file documents with the SEC, related to the Flow Control and chair merger and the Tyco shareholder votes related to the transaction within the next week. Due to the SEC filing process, we are restricted in what we can say with respect to the transactions and therefore ask that you limit your questions during to Q&A session to those related to our quarterly results.  In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in average revenue per user, backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to our operating margins during the call exclude special items and these metrics are non-GAAP measures. Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release. Now, let me quickly recap this quarter’s results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.4 billion increased 9% year-over-year with organic revenue growth of 7%, nicely ahead of our previous guidance. Foreign currency negatively impacted revenue by less than 1% and acquisitions added three percentage points to our overall year-over-year revenue growth.  Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.71 and included charges of $0.15 related to special items. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.86. Now, let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments.\n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Antonella and good morning everyone. Our second quarter performance was highlighted by strong organic revenue growth. Order momentum over the last few quarters, coupled with continued growth in our ADT Residential business continues to drive higher top line growth. Our large and stable base of recovering and service revenue, which represented 45% of our revenue in the quarter, coupled with strong operating leverage led by the Fire and Security manufacturing businesses drove the operating performance of this quarter.  Additionally the benefit from our restructuring and cost containment initiatives helped fund additional investments across our businesses. Overall, operating income before special items increased 15% and earnings per share before special items increased 18% year-over-year. From an orders perspective, we saw continued acceleration from the 8% year-over-year order growth we saw in the first quarter, to 13% growth in the quarter we just exited, with 9.5% growth in Fire and Security and 21% growth in Flow Control. Our order activity combined with continued growth in our backlog puts us on track for even better operating performance in our seasonally stronger second half.  Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for each of the businesses. Starting with the new Fire and Security segment, the combined portfolio provides the nice mix of service, installation and product offerings. Top line growth in the quarter benefited from both an acceleration in organic growth, as well as the contribution from the various bolt-on acquisitions we recently completed.  Our operating performance in the quarter was strong. Operating income grew twice as fast as revenue, resulting in a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin year-over-year.  In ADT, recurring revenue, which represents almost 90% of ADT’s total revenue continued to growth with a nice increase in both the account base and average revenue per user.  In Flow Control, the ramp up in orders over the past few quarters has translated into solid organic revenue growth. We have been booking some large orders in border, which positively impacted our order rates this quarter. This keeps us on track to achieve at 14% operating margin for the fourth quarter.  With that, let me turn it over to George for some more detailed revenue of Fire and Security. \n",
      "George Oliver : Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Before I walk you through our results for the quarter, I would like to tell you about the new Fire and Securities segment. We are a leading global provider of Fire and Security products and services. We serve a variety of markets worldwide, including commercial, industry and retail, as well as residential markets outside of North America to name a few.  Our global market leading position and broad portfolio of products and services is supported by our highly trained worldwide sales force of 7,000 people, market leading brands and innovative technologies. These factors differentiate us from our competitors and it is these strengths that we plan to continue to leverage as we move forward.  Our broad portfolio of products and services allows us to partner with our customers, to help them meet their needs ranging from product design, manufacture and insulation, to maintenance and upgrades. On this systems install and services side, we design, sell and install service and monitor electronic security systems, as well as fire detection and suppression products across the glob.  The combined mix if our products with our worldwide sales, service and instillation footprint is unmatched in the Fire and Security industry. By leveraging our global reach, we plan to continue to take advantage of our ability to provide best-in-class integrated solutions to our diverse customer base.  Our product businesses design, manufacture and sell fire protection, electronic security and life safety products, including fire suppression, intrusion security, access control, anti-theft and video management systems.  Our products are sold directly to customers, as well as through our extensive global network of distributors. We are a technology leader in our industry. Innovation and new product development are critical to our success, its something that our customers expect.  As a result, this is an area that has been and will continue to be a primary focus as we stay ahead of the technology curve through organic investment in our R&D centers, while strengthening our portfolio with a disciplined acquisition process.  In fact, we had a number of very nice strategic bolt-on acquisitions that we completed this past quarter. These investments expand our presence in key high growth markets and developed countries, as well as strengthen our product portfolio and service offerings in key vertical markets.  As an example, this past quarter we acquired a majority of ownership state in Reliance, which is a leading fire protection solutions provider in China. We expect the addition of Reliance’s expertise in fire insulation, as well as their service business will further strengthen our presence in China, and allow us to expand our foot print, customer base and systems installation and service opportunities in the region.  In addition to an attractive portfolio, the Fire and Security business has a very nice cash conversion profile and an attractive return on investment. Our goal is to build upon the solid foundation we have today, but increasing our mix of higher margin service revenue, growing our presence in high growth markets, strengthening our product leadership by driving technology and to provide innovative customer solutions in insuring that we are operate with an efficient cost structure.  Now, let me turn to our results for the second quarter. Overall revenue for the quarter of $2.6 billion increased 5% year-over-year. Organic revenue grew 3.5% with acquisitions adding an additional three percentage points in foreign currency, exchange rates decreasing revenue by a modest 1%.  Focusing on the performance of our global installation service and product businesses, let me start with our global service platform, which is the largest portion of the portfolio. Service revenue represented about 45% of our revenue in the quarter and grew 3% organically year-over-year, with growth in all geographic regions.  Systems installation revenue which represented about 35% of total revenue in the quarter, declined 1% on an organic basis, as growth in Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in North America and AMEA, due to the softness in the non-residential construction market.  The remaining portion of fire and securities revenues come from our product businesses, which represented about 20% of our revenue this quarter. Organic revenue grew 14% as we continue to experience strong demand across fire protection products, life safety and security products. From a profit perspective, operating income before special items was $309 million and the year-over-year operating margin improved 70 basis points to 12.1%. Growth of our higher margin service revenue increased volume leverage in the product businesses and the continued positive impact of restructuring the cost containment initiatives drove the improvement.  Year-over-year total orders grew 9.5% with service up 6%, systems installed up 3% and products higher by 33%. Backlog of $4.7 billion increased 5% on a quarter and sequential basis. Old orders and backlog exclude the impact of foreign currency, but include the impact of recent acquisitions.  Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect continued strong performance in fire and security, with total revenue of approximately $2.7 billion and 4.5% organic revenue increase over the prior year.  From an operating income perspective, we expect the operating margin to improve 30 basis points year-over-year, as we leverage the increased revenue and continue to benefit from our productivity initiatives.  Before I pass it over to Naren, I’d like to thank the Fire and Security team for their continued dedication and successfully operating the business and delivering another solid quarter. I am very pleased with the team’s ability to continue to deliver solid results or making great progress in bringing the new Fire and Security organizations together. Now, let me turn it over to Naren.\n",
      "Naren Gursahaney: Thanks George and good morning everyone. Before I walk you through our results for the quarter, I’ll first provide some background on the ADT segment. Today ADT is the leader in the $12.5 billion residential and small business security market. With over 6.4 million customers in North America, we estimate ADTs market share at 25%, a position that makes us several times larger than the next biggest competitor.  The residential and small business security market has proven to be very resilient as industry data shows continued expansion, even through the recent economic downturn. However, we estimate that only about 20% of U.S. households have monitored security system today. In comparison, 65% of homes have broadband services, 85% have paid television services, primarily cable and satellite and 97% of households have wireless. So as successful as we’ve been, four out of five households remain potential new customers. ADTs leadership position is driven by the most prominent brand in the residential security industry. A network of six fully redundant euro certified, company owned and operated monitoring centers. More than 200 field locations across the U.S. and Canada and more than 16,000 trained security professionals. We are also supported by the industry’s largest dealer network, which now consists of over 400 ADT authorized dealers, who are exclusive to us in the security space.  With over 135 years in the industry, security is not just one of ADTs offerings, it is what we do. With the introduction of ADT Pulse about 18 months ago, we have expanded our offerings from traditional security to interactive home and small business security solutions. Pulse enables our customers to remotely arm and disarm their security system from their Smartphones and other web enabled devices and/or receive notification about events that occur on their premises.  Our new offerings also extend beyond security to home and small business automation, climate and light control and remote video monitoring, all of which can be tailored to an individual customer’s needs. Pulse has quickly become an important part of our portfolio and we continually look to add new features and capabilities. We built the greatest subscriber base business, with close to 90% of our revenue recurring, driving strong returns and steady cash flows. Our focus is one creating shareholder value by managing client key levers, growing our customer base, optimizing the cost of bringing on new customers, increasing the revenue we received from customers each month, lowering the cost of service delivery and lengthening the time our customers stay with us. We continuously work to balance these value drivers to optimize our returns.  Now, let me turn to our results for the second quarter. Revenue during the quarter was $807 million, an increase of 5% over the second quarter of last year. We achieved recurring revenue organic growth of 5%, which was driven by a 3.5% growth in Average Revenue Per User or ARPU and nearly 2% growth in our customer accounts.  Pulse continued it’s strong momentum with a take rate of just over 35% in our direct channel during the quarter. This compares to the 28% take rate we saw in the first quarter. We are also seeing nice improvements in the Pulse take rate in our small business channel, where the take rate has improved to 19% versus the low teens last quarter, and as Ed mentioned on the call in January, we began the initial roll out of pulse to our authorized dealers this quarter and expect our take rates to pick up in this channel as well.  ARPU was $37.98 for the quarter. As I previously mentioned, this represents a 3.5% improvement year-over-year. Revenue per user on new accounts, which was primarily influenced by the Pulse take rates was up 5% year-over-year to $44.50. Our annualized attrition rate was 13.2% for the quarter, which is flattened year-over-year, but modestly up 20 basis points sequentially. During the quarter we made the decision to accelerate our planned price escalations. The increased number of escalations in the quarter resulted in a modestly higher number of disconnects; however, this rate was consistent with what we’ve seen with price increases in the past. Operating income before special items was $199 million and the operating margin was 24.7%, both of which were in line with our expectations. The operating margin was down 40 basis points year-over-year as we continue to invest to grow our business. To put this into context, we’ve added more than 300 sales reps over the past 12 months, representing a 9% increase in our field sales force. To support this growth, we also increased our advertising expense and other lead generation activities. As a result our sales and marketing costs were up 14% year-over-year.  While new sales reps generally take some time to ramp up their productivity, unit sales increased 90% year-over-year and we are confident this investment will continue to pay off going forward. At the same time we continue to be disciplined on our cost structure and a reduced G&A as a percent of revenue by 15 basis points year-over-year.  As we look to the third quarter, for recurring revenue, which represents 90% of our business, we expect organic growth to be consistent with what we saw in the second quarter in the 4% to 5% range. For non-recurring revenue, which represents the remaining 10% of the business, we anticipate a slight headwind as we are planning to begin that change in the ownership model for our Pulse equipment sales.  Historically about 30% of our system sold through our direct channel have been customer owned. As the Pulse systems include proprietary technology, it’s important for ADT to retain ownership of these assets. From a reported revenue perspective, the shift to more ADT owned systems will have a short term negative impact as revenue will be recognized over the life of the customer relationship rather than upfront. Keep in mind that the non-recurring revenues, which include these equipment sales, represent less than 10% of our total revenues.  From an operating income perspective, this change will provide a slight tailwind as the investment is also amortized over the life of the customer relationship, rather than being fully recognized at the time of sale.  On a cash return basis, which is really the important way to evaluate a subscriber business like ADT’s, this change has virtually no impact on our economics. So for the third quarter we expect recurring revenue to continue to grow in the 4% to 5% range and non-recurring revenue to decline about 7% organically, again due to the Pulse ownership change.  Overall, this is expected to result in year-over-year segment organic loan of approximately 3.5% for the third quarter. Our operating margin is likely to be in line with what we saw in the second quarter at about 25%. Now, let me turn things over to Patrick.\n",
      "Patrick Decker: Thanks Naren. Good morning everyone. As I provided an overview of Flow Control on the last quarters call, I’ll jump right into the quarter’s results. Overall revenue was $996 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year with 21% organic revenue growth. The revenue increase in the quarter was driven by strong growth in all three platforms.  In valve controls revenue grew 18% organically in the quarter, led by the oil and gas process industries. Incremental volume in this business continues to produce good year-over-year operating leverage.  Orders growth in the quarter remained strong with a 20% increase year-over-year, fueled by growth across the mining, oil and gas and process industries. We are in the part of the cycle where incoming orders are still outpacing outgoing shipments, so backlog continued to grow and we expect revenue to continue to grow in the second half of the year. In thermal controls, top line growth was boosted by the acceleration of installation work to complete a major capital project that began last year, contributing to the year-over-year organic growth of 32%. Although total revenue was better than we expected, the unseasonably warm winter in North America led to lower product sales, which carry a higher margin.  Organic revenue growth in water was 21% as a result of some new projects coming on-line and an easy compare with the prior year quarter. We continue to expect revenues in our operating margins and water to improve during the second half of fiscal 2012, as double digit order growth over the last two quarters continues to convert into revenue.  Overall total flow control orders in the quarter increased 21% year-over-year, our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit orders growth, so backlog of $1.9 billion increased 4% on a quarter sequential basis. Operating income before special items was $114 million and the operating margin was 11.4%. The impact of the year-over-year increase in revenue was partially offset by mix in thermal controls related to the warm winter impact on product sales, as well as $4 million of cost associated with the legacy project in water that we retained from a prior divestiture. We estimate that these two items negatively impacted our operating income by about $10 million and our operating margin by 100 basis points year-over-year. As we move into the second half of the year, we remain confident that significantly improving conditions in water, coupled with converting our order book in valves will drive improved operating margin performance. Specifically in the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase 12% year-over-year to about $1.4 billion with organic revenue growth in the low teens. We expect the operating margin to approach 13% in the third quarter, keeping us on a path to an operating margin of 14% for the fourth quarter. Now, I’ll turn things over to Frank.\n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: Thanks Patrick and good morning everyone. Let me quickly touch on a few other important items. First, our cash position and overall balance sheet remains strong. In the quarter we generated free cash flow of $326 million, which included $76 million of cash paid for special items, primarily related to restructuring and separation activities.  Adjusted free cash flow was $402 million. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow of $415 million increased to 21% year-over-year. We continue to invest in the future growth of our businesses and as a result we increased our capital expenditures and dealers spend by about $130 million year-to-date and this is reflected in the free cash flow results. Additionally as we previously disclosed, during the month of January we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $100 million. We were restricted for much of the quarter in our share buyback program, due to the pending announcement of the merger of our flow control business with Pentair. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and we expect to resume share repurchase activity during the third fiscal quarter. Next, corporate expense before special items was $75 million in the second quarter, which was favorable against our original estimates, partly due to the timing of project spend. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect corporate expense to increase to approximately $95 million to $100 million. Keep in mind that we traditionally see an up-tick in corporate expense in the second half of the year due to the timing of many of our annual actuary evaluations.  Given the year-to-date favor ability in corporate expense and the fact that we continue to make progress in reducing structural corporate expense with ongoing cost containment initiatives, we now expect corporate expense for the full year, before special items to be approximately $360 million, which compares to our original estimate of $390 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter before the impact of special items was 17.2% and we expect the tax rate in the third quarter to be approximately 18%. We continue to expect a 19% to 20% effective rate for the full year. Now, let me turn things back over to Ed to wrap up this morning’s call.\n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Frank. Before we open up the lines for questions, I want to spend a few minutes for our overall guidance for the third quarter and the full year.  We expect revenue for the third quarter to increase just above $4.5 billion. In terms of bottom line results, we expect to see a nice sequential improvement in our third quarter operating results in all three businesses, given recent order rates and improving business conditions and the flows water business. This operational improvement in fire and security, ADT and flow control is expected to contribute $0.11 of earnings on a quarter sequential basis.  As Frank mentioned, we expect the sequential increase in corporate expense to $95 million to $100 million in the third quarter, which compares to $75 million in the second quarter, which is expected to cost us about $0.05 per share on a quarter sequential basis.  When combined, these items result in a net increase of about $0.06 per share on a quarter sequential basis. With an expected average share count of about 470 million shares, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the third quarter to be about $0.92. Based on our year-to-date performance and our guidance for the third quarter, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance to approximately $3.65 compared to our previous guidance of $3.55 to $3.60 per share. Our full year guidance incorporates a share count of approximately 470 million. Lastly I want to thank our teams around the world for their effort in delivering another strong quarter, while at the same time preparing for the separation.  Thanks for joining us on the call and operator, if we can open up the line for any questions.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n",
      "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\n",
      "Ed Breen: Good morning Jeff.\n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: Good morning.\n",
      "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research:  Since we have Naren on the line, a couple of questions for him if I could. Just first on Pulse, two thoughts there Naren; first, it’s not that you scored willing enough to the dealers. Any initial color on the take rate there or their attitude to sell it and install it.  And also I was kind of wondering, you made the comments about evolving this in home automation and other things. What is your capability to go back and resell and up-sell the Pulse customer. We’ve always heard the dialogue that it’s kind of tough to go back and sell Pulse to the legacy customer, but via this set up, in the sense that you can actually dial up the features that have Pulse, kind of after sale down the road.\n",
      "Naren Gursahaney: Okay, well Jeff, let me start with the first question about Pulse with the dealers. Our real focus during the second quarter was with our largest dealer. We’ve been working very closely with them to make sure that the sales installation and provisioning processes work smoothly.  As I mentioned in the past, this is a very different product configuration for them, it’s a very different sales process for them and a very different install and we are working very closely with them to make sure they get the benefit of the lessons learned when we roll this out through our direct channel and even in our direct channel, we focused on our custom home channel first, because they were more used to selling and installing the more complex systems.  So we’ve got a lot of work to do with our dealers, but they seem very excited by the product and they are very interested in doing it, so I expect that we will see a ramp up, but I think it will be a slow ramp up and we are going to be very methodical to make sure that we do it right and really manage that customer experience, where every customer experience is good one, so I’d expect a slow methodical ramp up. Right now it’s probably only about 1% of our dealers via direct sales at this time. So it will be a ramp up as we move through this year and into next year. On the second question about taking upgrades out to our existing Pulse customers, actually that will be, yes, will continue to be a big opportunity for us. One is Pulse is very much of a software driven solution, so new capabilities we can push out to our customers, so that they have access to it immediately. In fact, we’ve already pushed out new upgrades to the software that’s out there.  And then as we bring on new hardware into the ecosystem, customers will have the opportunity to buy that hardware from us or go to traditional retail outlets to buy three way enabled devices that they’ll be able to install in their home, enroll into their Pulse system, very much in the same way you add a peripheral to your PC today.  So it should be a very easy install for them depending on the specific hardware and then again, very easy to enroll it in the Pulse system and be able to use it. We are testing new products all the time in our labs, developing the software for it and then the new software we push out, it’s already enabled in there.\n",
      "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: I was wondering on the accounting change on equipment, is that only related to Pulse accounts and is there any change in amortization rates or any other accounting changes for the Pulse specifically, relative to how you’ve been treating accounts historically.\n",
      "Naren Gursahaney: I would say it’s primarily focused on the Pulse equipment, because of the intellectual property there and there is no changes at all from an accounting perspective. Again, it’s juts whether we treat them as ADT owned or customer owned, so the accounting, the attrition curves, everything remains the same. \n",
      "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: And then just off for a header Frank and then I’ll jump off. Share count of 470 is actually drifting a little north from where you’re at. Could you just provide some color on why that is and you kind of how – I guess sounds like your not really stepping at the share repurchase in a meaningful way, so you’ve got some creep playing into the back half. Is that the way to think about it?\n",
      "Ed Breen: Well, there’s always some adjustment that takes place in the share account as a result of exercise activity and so on, but we will be back in the market during the third quarter, with sure activity and that will be bring the share count below what it would have been had we not been in the market. So we are at 469 at the end of Q2, 470 is where we think we are going to be as an assumption of the combination of the reverse activity and any other activity including exercise activity. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen: Jeff, its just the timing of the buybacks as we were at the market for the last couple of months because of the flow control Pentair transaction. So things kind of got pushed into the second half of the year. \n",
      "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: All right, great. Thank you. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Jeff. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Your line is open. \n",
      "Scott Davis – Barclays: Hi, good morning guys. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Hey Scott. \n",
      "Scott Davis - Barclays: Naren, I just want to follow-up on Jeff’s question, because I think it’s interesting. The whole thought of protecting your intellectual prosperity, I mean is this essentially so that after the three-year contract runs out that somebody can shop around to get their party monitoring services and use your equipment in that process. Is that kind of the thought process here? \n",
      "Naren Gursahaney : For me that’s clearly a piece of it. We’ll have ownership or those assets, so there could be some restriction there. But again with the amount of intellectual property, I mean the traditional security system was generally off the shelf type of equipment, no real new intellectual property in there, kind of pretty standard stuff that’s been out there. With Pulse we made a significant investment in that technology; we want to make sure that we have adequate control over it. \n",
      "Scott Davis - Barclays: Yes, no it makes sense. Naren, I wanted to talk a little bit about Brink's and just do a little bit of a look back. I know you don’t consider Brink's as a segment or anything else all integrated, but there was some kind of angst when you did the deal that you might loose some sales folks and accounts. I mean can you give us a sense of a postmortem after the deal of kind of what percentage of the sales guys you are able to keep and what percentage of the accounts you are able to keep and just give us a sense of how that deal’s worked our so far. \n",
      "Naren Gursahaney :   Well, I think it still Scott has been very good deal for us, from the synergies we promised and we committed, we delivered, all of those. The integration I’d say is virtually complete. We still have some kind of backend IT systems that need to be finished from an integration perspective and we have pushed that out a little bit, because some of the work, IT work we have to do to support separation. But operationally everything, there is full integration there.  From a talent perspective, I’d say on the sales side we were able to retain the people there and they continue to be very active members, not just in the sales force, but of our management team and our leadership teams throughout the organization. We did loose a few people, some branch level General Mangers and that was really just because of the difference we have in structure.  We have a sales structure and an operation structure that operate integrated, but separate. So there weren’t as many General Manger roles. We lost a dew people there. We kind of knew that that was going to happen and from an account perspective, we’ve been able to retain those accounts and again it’s an integral part of our customer base. \n",
      "Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay and just a quick follow-up. How much into your accounts did you purchase in the quarter. \n",
      "Naren Gursahaney :   Our growth in dealer accounts was about 9%, same as the growth we saw in the direct side. \n",
      "Scott Davis - Barclays: So what is the dollar value of that, or… \n",
      "Naren Gursahaney : I don’t have that off hand, but we can get back to you with that. \n",
      "Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay, okay, thanks guys. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Scott. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning.\n",
      "Ed Breen : Good morning Steve. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Let me just lead with the first question on separation cost, $98 million year-to-date. How are you tracking as you think about sort of that bigger, much bigger $700 million I think that you put out there for the full year. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Yes, we are still tracked in to that number, more than $50 million of it as we rolled it up recently. Remember in there is some restructuring numbers in addition to the other restructuring that we announced of about $125 million to $150 million. So we are tracked in to it, but a lot of hits in the very back half of the year. \n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: I don’t know if you’re going to add to that, the reason it hits the back half is primarily because of some of the debt refinancing. When we see, the majority of that spend its going to be in the summer time frame when we go though all that activity, so we are on track. \n",
      "Ed Breen: The debt refinance, frankly that is the single biggest piece by far on a percentage basis and the good news with that is there is some payback on that, because of the rates we’ll get on the refinancing. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: I was going to say that might look even better than when you first started talking about it right. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Yes, it’s slightly better hopefully. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, secondly, a lot of good thing to talk about, but let me just ask about the systems installation decrease, that 1%. George, just may be give me a sense, you talked about soft non-res construction markets versus prior year, but as I recall a year ago, it wasn’t a lot better from an end market perspective. Maybe just give a little color for what you see going on. \n",
      "George Oliver : I mean we are driven. When you look at the key metrics that drive that segments of our businesses, its really, the lead indicator is the architectural billing index and that has just been just slightly favorable over the last few quarters and so we are seeing that in the market, and so as we’ve said in previous quarters that we continue to be very selective with the projects that we do take on, certainly with the focus on the projects that drive recurring revenue and service, and so when you look at that we continue to win lower volume, continue to expand our margins and making sure that we are positioned from a resource standpoint to be able to grow our service revenue. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, so it sounds like your positive there as you look forward. \n",
      "George Oliver : In the quarter we are down about 1% on the installed side, but going forward I mean as we look at our orders, our orders are improving slightly in that space. Certainly we’ve been very aggressive on the service growth and that’s beginning to accelerate also. But when you look at the key indices that drive the market as far as products and square footage, the forecast is not for any significant increase going forward. And so we are not banking on a lot of volume there, we are going to continue to be selective and we think certainly that does create the installed base and helps us drive the recurring revenue and the service revenue. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein:   Great and then finally, Ed and Naren, I keep asking every quarter about the cable company response and their beta tests and they are rolling it out. Are you seeing or just once again I want to understand on both pricing and on share in any way, are you guys seeing any king of impact in any of the cities where your co-located with where they have aggressive efforts. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Yes, note Steve that the cable guys have rolled out some additional markets. I think you might have saw some announcements from them. But when you look at the metrics and the range team tracks them by market, we look at them, I guess Naren looks at them even more than I do I’m sure, but there is no change in any of our metrics in those markets and it think we are feeling very good competitively.  Cable guys have now been some markets for almost 18 months like we have, it’s a pretty decent amount of time to have some tack record and there really is no change in metrics whether its pricing, discount, anything there and with us now rolling out with the dealer networks which will be another almost 4,000 sales people over time, again its going to take time as Naren said, another 4,000 people marketing it, I think we are in a nice position over the next couple of years.\n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: And Naren would you add anything in terms of where your guys are going head to head with the cable guys and coming back with any kind of storage or anecdotes or is there any kind of color here about why you are winning, you’re not getting impacted.\n",
      "Ed Breen: Well again it’s head-to-head, but kind of a different scenario. Most of them are selling over the phone where we are selling face-to-face, so we are not necessarily head-to-head in the house. But I think our guys still feel very good about the offering we have out there, they feel very good about the reputation we have out there for service.  Clearly we are seeing other competitors be aggressive with their pricing, but I think also people understand promotional pricing has always been aggressive in that industry and I think there are a lot of people who are waiting to see what happens to those prices over the long term. I think especially those who know ADT or have been with ADT for years know that we are very methodical and thoughtful with our price escalation policy.  So I mean our sales reps don’t feel comfortable, but they have what they need to not just to compete, but to compete and win. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: All right. Thank you. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Steven. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Ajay Kejriwal with FBR Capital Markets. Your lien is open.  \n",
      "Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Thank you. Good morning. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Good morning. \n",
      "Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Naren, you talked about accelerating the pricing escalations in the quarter. So may be if you can talk a little bit about what was the driver, what’s the opportunity there and then also may be any color on the pricing versus attrition economics. How much could you push pricing without attrition kind of increasing to the level that kind of off set the economics there? \n",
      "Naren Gursahaney:   Sure. Well, as I mentioned in my comments, we are always trading off those five drivers of new accounts, subscriber acquisition cost, the revenue for user cost to service and attrition and working hard to optimize that.  During this quarter we made a decision to accelerate, it was about a little over 900,000 customers, so about 15% of our customer base. We generally see about 1% disconnect rate when we make those notifications or escalations. In this case we were very similar to that.  So again when you look at our price increase, it was in 4% to 5% range. So taking up that many customers at that kid of rate, even loosing that 1% which we don’t like to do, the economics were still overwhelming. That was the right thing to do for the overall return of the business. So we’ll continue to look at the all of those different trade-off and understand who we optimize.  I think we are competitive in the market palace from a pricing perspective, so I don’t think there are going to be big moves in the pricing necessarily, but we are going to continue to fine-tune that. We have never been the cheapest player out there, we’ve always been the premium player and we believe that our services and our infrastructure and support behind that justify that, as well as the innovation that we are bringing to make, so we’ll continue to look at that. \n",
      "Ed Breen: And back to the post comments Naren made, that’s really our favorite way to get increased pricing obviously. We are giving more to the customer or we get a higher price and we are all convinced its going to be a sticker account, which is one of Naren’s five levers, is to keep the account longer. So that’s our preferable and focused way to actually really get price moved up. \n",
      "Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Very helpful, thank you and then may be one question for George on the competitive dynamics. So one of your large competitors has publicly talked about execution issues and may be could be shedding assets in Europe. Could you may be talk about what this means in terms of opportunity for you, be it share gains or may be even as a potential buyer of those assets. \n",
      "George Oliver:   Well, as we’ve demonstrated we look at all opportunities, and we’ve been perusing a strategic, a pipeline of strategy bolt-on acquisitions that have added nice revenue and ability to be able to leverage that within our infrastructure and we will continue to do that going forward.  When you look at our performance, a lot of our permanence has been driven by the investments we’ve been making in products, so when you look at the continued investments or increase in those investments, its our ability with our regional footprint across the globe to be able to design and install systems and then even more importantly be able to service.  So I think it’s a combination of those, having a good position in all three segments. It really has provided us to be able to get though this cycle and now with the investments we are making be able to accelerate our growth going forward.  \n",
      "Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is open. \n",
      "Gautam Khanna - Cowen:   Yes, good morning guys. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Good morning Gautham.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna - Cowen: Just wanted to ask about the flow order pipeline, obviously its strong showing this quarter, water coming back. I mean is this the high water mark in terms of kind of year-over-year order growth or kind of what is the duration of the pipeline you have out there. How far can you see out? \n",
      "Patrick Decker:   Yes, this is Patrick. The way I would answer that would be, we expect to continue to see robust order growth in the valve control business, that’s really the one, one of the three businesses, but truly is a backlog business.  The other two businesses water and thermal are typically quick turn kind of businesses, expect when these bit major capital products kind of flow through. So I would expect over the back half of the year, valves and water orders will continue to be stronger. We do have the impact here for couple of quarters with the year-over-year compare with this big major capital project in thermal that we completed in this last quarter.  We are currently pursuing two other major capital projects that were close to us earning drills on its well. But those probably won’t hit the order book until either latter part of this fiscal year or even early 2013. \n",
      "Gautam Khanna - Cowen: Okay and then just to follow up on the prior question about the ADT attrition picking up, to the price increases, that typically happens immediately or is there kind of a multi quarter kind of fall out once you raise price.\n",
      "Patrick Decker: No, we generally get a pretty quick feedback, some activity in the call center. Some of those we are able to save and some of them we are not. Now again we do have some additional escalations that will happen in 3Q, not to the magnitude that we did in the second quarter, probably 60% to 70% of what we did during the second quarter. So again there could be may be a 10 basis point head wind as we looked at 3Q. \n",
      "Gautam Khanna - Cowen: Okay, thank you guys. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Thank you Gautham. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Hey, good morning. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Hey Steve. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Just on the quarterly, the next quarters guide, is there any specific reason why conversion at ADT Resi would be kind of weaker than it’s been on a sustainable basis. I mean you mentioned some marketing aspects this quarter, may be there’s something to do with the account change that makes the conversion a little bit weaker, because you had a good quarter, on the third quarter last year, I don’t know if that’s seasonally or not and then the flow revenue guidance of about 12% is good, but orders up 21%. Is there something kind of the tail of the backlog?  And then one last question just on corporate, for the last like several years you guys have guided corporate up, for the next quarter and you’ve beaten on corporate. I mean I don’t quite understand the strategy there, because your never really going to get credit for that, so using corporate is kind of like a hedge to our guidance. It doesn’t really seem to make sense. I mean what is going on there and it seems like it’s sustain ably lower over time, but you guys keep guiding it higher every quarter. So just a question on those three items. \n",
      "Ed Breen:   Steve, let me start with the question on the ADT margin rate I guess. You know a part of it really is the business model and I’ll try to do this at a very high level. When we sell a system through our direct channel, I assume that the cost, the net cost to us is about $1000. About $500 of that, all of our marketing spend and all of our fixed cost related to sales, we expense in the current period. So the only thing that would get differed in an ADT owned system is the sales commission, the equipment that goes in the home and the installation cost.  So while from a cash perspective the economics are very good, we do take a P&L hit and actually our margin rate on an incremental account, an ADT owned account is actually negative in the quarter that we had that account. So as we grow there will be that P&L pressure on there. However again, looking at it on a cash basis, the IRR, net present value of those accounts are very attractive and it is creating long-term value for us.  So its an initial hit up front and then as there is amortization and we pull that differed revenue off and we get the recurring revenue, those margins get significantly better over time. So clearly it’s just the account and your treatment of those accounts that we’ve got online. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, got you. \n",
      "Patrick Decker: This is Patrick. I’ll take the flow question regarding organic growth. So again to put it in perspective, for the full year we are expecting organic growth in the low teens compared to 1% in 2011. So we are beginning to see the turn there.  Just to look at the pieces here Steve and see how the mix works, we are expected continued low teen growth in valves and that really is just a matter of timing of backlog shipments. Again this backlog can turnover a six to nine month timeframe, so that will continue.  We are seeing the pickup in water and that will be a very stronger double-digit growth year-over-year as well, and again more of that will hit us in even Q4 into 2013, which is when we get the full-on impact of those water projects.  And then really what is moderating, some of that revenue growth versus what we would put it in order, I mean most of our thermal business is a quick turn shift within the quarter, but last year we had significantly growth in thermal during 2011 and through the first half of this year and that was really driven largely by the completion of a couple of major capital projects.  So again, you are going to get a tougher year-over-year compare in the second half of the year, so we will show a modest decline in reported revenue for thermal in the second half. But as I mentioned earlier, its not a sign of help in terms of an issue to major projects that we are closely signing that will then benefit their team. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, that makes sense, in the corporate. \n",
      "Frank Sklarsky : Steve on the corporate side, and this is Frank, two primary items there. When we look out to the third quarter, which is the quarter we normally do our actuarial liability evaluations, we really don’t know exactly what the number is going to be until we complete that analytical process. But we do have an estimate therefore with the trajectory and what we think that will be, that’s one time that impacts the sequential uplift.  The other item is really the timing of project expense, where we see some sequential basis and some additional spending on product related items in the third quarter versus Q2.  Now that said, with respect to the corporate hedge or whatever, that’s why we are saying this time around that before the year it will be $360 million versus the previous estimate we had our there at 390 so to your point, we are defiantly making progress on structural cost within the general and administrative category and the corporate category. So we are comfortable at this time taking that number down to the year in total. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay and the one last quick question, this is a backward looking question, about stuff that’s in your prior, your 10-K that was filed several months ago. With regards to all the NOLs that you guys have, first of all, where did most of those come from? I mean there has been a lot of deals in Tyco over time and looks like they kind of carry through, some of them carry through 2030 and I guess specifically the ones in the U.S., the $1.8 billion in the U.S., are those transferable easily and then is it pretty evenly spread out through the next 20 years?  If you could just maybe describe the genesis of those NOLs and then your ability to transfer them, and also if there is a chunk that’s expires near term, maybe just describe that a little bit more. And then that’s a question on your 10-K that was filed every three months ago, four months ago. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen : Steve we’ve never disclosed where the NOL have been generated and by what business in our filings. The only think I can say about that, I keep in mind our opening comments that we had and we are in the registration period and I know the production is more geared to where they are going.  The one thing that I will point you to is we have disclosed in the ADT From 10 what the expectations thereof are, NOLs that they have and what their future exception is of what they will get of their share of Tyco and we also some information about that disclosed in a slides that we posted in regards to the Form 10, but that’s about all we can say on the right now. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, all right, it was worth a try. Thanks. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Steve. \n",
      "Operator: We have a question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Yes, thanks, good morning. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Hi there. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : So Naren, you talked about the metrics in the household in the U.S., relatively low compared to cable. I mean in terms of the market research you’ve done, where you think that tenders should make them go and what kind of strategies can you adopt to drive up penetration without using price as a method for doing that.\n",
      "Naren Gursahaney: Well, I think I would use value as the driver and we believe that over time and it could be a long time to get there, that its actually double to the 20% kind of penetration rate, which is still well below all of the – excuse me, it’s the 40% that would be still well below all the other services that we talked about. But it really comes down to, can we continue to strengthen the value proposition starting with the security piece, but all the other monitoring we do in the homes, fire, critical conditions, carbon monoxide, etcetera, and then bringing the home automation piece.  At this point in time, with pulse being out there for about 18 months we have anecdotal evidence that it is brining in people who would not have considered a security system in the past, but there is just not enough market data out there to show whether that’s truly moved the needed or not and we’ll continue to keep an eye on that. \n",
      "Ed Breen: I think a big driver Naren’s team has been looking at here is we haven’t been overly public about it yet is, can we really present to the consumer the savings you can get from using the automation in the system and we’ve mentioned this before, but the utility savings on the home used properly, along with you get a discount on your insurance anyway if you have a security system.  My gut is over time, those two combined is a pretty large number and it covers a lot of the recurring revenue that the consumer would pay us. So promoting that overtime and all those type of things I think does expand the pie. If you can cover a lot of the cost and get the full security system with automation, that’s a pretty attractive propositions. So I think you will be seeing more of that from us in the future. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay and then, I don’t know if I missed the data point, but can you just throw out there what your ARPU was in your gross adds in ADT this quarter.\n",
      "Antonella Franzen : The average ARPU was 37.98 and the gross ads were – the account-based ads were about 2%. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Net was 2%. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : 2%, but the ARPU on gross adds?\n",
      "Antonella Franzen : 3.5% and the average ARPU for the quarter was 37.98. \n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: Nigel, I’m sorry, were you asking what the ARPU was on the new accounts. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : The new accounts, yes. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen : 24.50. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay great. And then you are making some adjustments to the accounting in ADT but how does your accounting compare to some of your accounts. I mean there is not a lot of great public information out there, but some of the comps our there do have higher EBITDA margins and I’m wondering, is that a function of accounting or is there a significantly upside potentially to your EBITDA margins there and I’d love that comments.\n",
      "Ed Breen: Well, first just a clarification, we are not changing the accounting, we are changing the business model, its really in a mix of ADT owned versus customer owned. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : That’s clear, sure.\n",
      "Ed Breen: And from a comp perspective, I guess most of our peers within the security industry are not public companies. And many of them use a dealer model which would be similar I assume to the way we do handle that, where you create the intangible and you amortize it over the life of that customer relationship.\n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: Yes, this is one Nigel you might be talking about is a security comp that is almost, it is a 100% dealer. So they go to that model, but we have also our direct model, so that is one difference when you look at the accounting of it. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Going back to the question earlier, on the accounting for our dealer-acquired systems, those would actually be marginally accretive when we buy it. We amortize those over the life of the relationship, it is an accelerated amortization, but we do get the revenues. So it might be in the high 20s to low 30s gross margin, which is lower than our overall gross margins, but again accretive, modestly accretive to our operating margins. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then one final one for Pat. In the flow business, can you just give us a sense in terms of where the values, water and thermal business are compared to their prior peak levels? \n",
      "Patrick Decker:   Compared to what? \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Their prior peak levels.\n",
      "Patrick Decker: In terms of profitability. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : No, no, in terms of revenues. \n",
      "Patrick Decker: In terms of revenues, I can’t give you specific numbers on the three splits right now, but I would say just kind of anecdotally I would say valves is getting back closer to where we were pre-crisis levels, but there is still room to go there and I think that we are certainly see very buoyant activity in the market still in terms of project bidding, etcetera. So there is still a very, very nice runway there in front of them. What obviously is coming out of a trough and so well below what our peak levels were there going forward, and so we are expecting very good growth there. And I could say thermal is kind of flat lying right now, relative to this big project we had over the last year of so, but have some very, very nice projects in front of us that we think will then be a nice booster revenue in ‘13 and beyond. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay, that’s helpful, thanks. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen: Operator, we have time for one more quick question, if there is anyone else in the queue. \n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Deane Dray with Citi. Your line is open. \n",
      "Deane Dray - Citi : Thank you. Good morning. I don’t know if it’s a question for Patrick or Frank, could we get some color regarding that charge taken for the divested business. What triggered it and are there any other sort of contingent liabilities related to that divesture. \n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: I mean that’s one that we’ve had some modest charges in the past. I think as Patrick would agree, that project is nearing completion and will be cleared from anymore significant further liabilities done or there might be a some modest trailing items in the upcoming quarter, but this is one where the project is very much near completion. So we don’t see any more significant items in anything. We do see the modest nature we got a covered in the forecast that Patrick went through. \n",
      "Patrick Decker : And I would just add, it was a complex project that we inherited as part of a business that we divested and was just getting started at that time that the business was divested. Its proved challenging. We are very close nearing completion. It’s not a project within our suite spot, so we are wrapping it up now and hopefully putting it behind us. \n",
      "Deane Dray - Citi : Great, thank you and just then just last one from me would be for George. The word selective came up in describing the installation business and I know in the past year there was some initiatives to be more selective about the projects that you were going after. So if you could just give us an updated as to how has that initiative played out, what that means for the installed base and may be in terms of also the profitability of these installations.\n",
      "George Oliver:   I mean I would start by when you look at the installation market it has been down, it really tends to decline back in 2008 and is really still at the bottom and so in spite of that we have continued to maintain our market shares with what we’ve been doing in the installation space.  And so when we say selective, its making sure that from a resource standpoint we are applying our resources, where not only can we drive a profitable project installation, but also it drives recurring services down the road. And so its really around allocation of resources to ultimately drive improved returns over the lifecycle of the project. And so as you’ve seen from the results, we have been very successful in improving the margins not only on the installation side, but also continuing to be positioned to be able to get to recurring revenue just tied to those projects. \n",
      "Deane Dray - Citi : Great, thank you. \n",
      "George Oliver: Thanks. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen: Operator, that concludes our call. \n",
      "Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.\n"

      "Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Scientific Games First Quarter 2017 Investor Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Bill Pfund, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n",
      "Bill Pfund: Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone. During today's call, we will discuss our 2017 first quarter results and operating performance, followed by a question and answer period. With me this afternoon are Kevin Sheehan, Chief Executive Officer; KJ Tjon, Chief Operating Officer and Mike Quartieri, Chief Financial Officer.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and a replay of this webcast and the accompanying materials will be archived in the Investors section at scientificgames.com. Now let me turn the call over to Kevin.\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Thanks, Bill. And good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. Our first quarter results mark the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases in both revenue and attributable EBITDA. Revenue grew 6% to $725 million. On a constantan currency basis revenue would have been up nearly 8%. Our attributable EBITDA increased 11% to $287 million, reflecting the higher revenue and 160 basis points improvement in our margin. Our margin benefited from the actions we took in the fourth quarter to streamline our organizational structure. This is a great start to the year, all three of our operating business segment contributed to the revenue and earnings growth. Our success is rooted in the efforts of entire team pulling together and I'd like to give my complements to all of our Scientific Game employees around the globe. I believe we are starting to see some real momentum across our businesses. In our gaming business, sales of gaming machines provided a strong boost to our results. Global unit shipments were up 24% over the prior year, table products also turned in an exceptional performance. Revenue was up 16%, reflecting both solid organic growth in lease revenue from our shufflers, proprietary table games and other table products coupled with the addition of the DEQ acquisition. DEQ's products are a smart complementary tuck-in to our existing table games business. The acquisition was completed on January 18th with cash from our operating cash flow and was quickly integrated. Our lottery business generated revenue and attributable EBITDA growth despite having a tough comparison with last year due to the incremental sales associated with the $1.6 billion Powerball Jackpot. Our instant games business experienced a revenue gain of nearly 5% in the first quarter, driven by our ongoing efforts to help lotteries grow their market and an increase in license game products. And finally but certainly not in the least, our interactive division continues to shine, its results were driven by strong growth in our social gaming B2C business, our strategy of leveraging our existing library of game content and intellectual property continues to deliver rapid top-line growth. Revenue growth exceeded the industry average on a year-over-year basis and reflects both share gains and market expansion in a healthy growing industry. Complementing the strong organic growth of the Social Casino business on April 7 we completed the acquisition of Spicerack Media, the [indiscernible] of Spicerack develop what has become the number four social bingo app the popular Bingo Showdown mobile game. The addition of a social bingo app is highly complementary to our existing game portfolio. Bingo games have an attractive player profile and financial characteristics and the acquisition will be immediately accretive to our earnings. Joining us today for her first call is KJ our Chief Operating Officer. KJ will you please review the performance of the gaming and lottery segments.\n",
      "Karin-Joyce Tjon: Thanks, Kevin, good afternoon, everyone. Our gaming business generated an $18 million increase in revenue over the prior year despite a $5 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment AEBITDA also increased by $18 million primarily due to the impact from higher revenue coupled with lower SG&A expense that resulted from the organizational streamlining in the fourth quarter. The A EBITDA margin of 47.7% was a 240 basis points improvement over the prior year. As Kevin mentioned, a key element of the revenue growth in gaming was a 24% increase in global unit shipments of gaming machines. During the first quarter, we shipped 8,359 new gaming machines globally compared with 6,748 units in the prior year. In the U.S. and Canada we shipped 5,862 units including 3,139 replacement units, 250 VLTs Oregon, 861 CGTs to Illinois and 1,862 units for new casino openings and expansions. The demand from new casino openings included shipments for the Ilani Tribo Casino in Washington where we received a 57% share of the shop floor including participation units. In addition, we shipped units to the New Kansas Crossing Casino and some other casino expansions. The higher shipments reflected strong sales of both the pro waves cabinet and the expanded TwinStar family of gaming machines. Reflecting a favorable mix our average sales price rose to $17,015 from $16,719 a year ago. In gaming operations, revenue was down 7% year-over-year and flat on a quarterly sequential basis. On a quarterly sequential basis, our footprint of WAP and premium units declined 322 units, but that impact was offset by a 3% increase in the average daily revenue of $1.73 per unit. The increase in the daily revenue was largely due to the continued installation of high performing Gamescape unit in our footprint coupled up with the seasonal improvement. The success of our Gamescape cabinet featuring the Willy Wonka, world of Wonka content continue to generate exceptional player engagement in its initial installation. We will follow the success of Willy Wonka with the highly anticipated launch of THE SIMPSONS game near the end of the second quarter. Additionally, the development of the new fully digitized game table remains on track and we expect to launch this innovative product in the second half of the year. The footprint of other participation and leased units was essentially flat on a quarterly sequential basis. An increase from the installation of VLTs in Greece was offset by the removal of some lower performing units in other markets. In Greece, based on the expected rollout plan communicated by OPAP we expect to have our full complement of 5,000 units installed by mid-year 2018, with a majority of the units installed by year end 2017. Gaming systems revenue of $62 million was up from $60 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting slightly higher hardware sales. We have begun to see increased traction on our new innovative iVIEW4 display, which provides a dramatic revolution in player engagement for our systems customers. As Kevin noted table products revenue rose 16% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in the leased revenue from shufflers, proprietary table games, and other table products. The total installed base of proprietary table games progresses and shufflers continue to expand year-over-year on a quarter sequential basis, reflecting both organic growth from the introduction of our new products such as the Shuffle Star continue shuffler along with the benefit of the DEQ acquisition. Turning to Lottery. Our revenue increased $1 million inclusive of an unfavorable $2 million foreign currency translation. First quarter lottery results had a tough comparison to the prior year, where in the first quarter of 2016 it included about $5 million of incremental benefit from the $1.6 billion Powerball jackpot. Lottery segment AEBITDA increased $4 million or 5% compared to the prior year quarter, largely due to the impact of the higher revenue, lower SG&A expense, resulting from lower payroll and associated cost and a slight increase in EBITDA from our joint ventures. Looking a bit closer to revenue. Instant games revenue increased $6 million or nearly 5% over the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in revenue from sales of license games along with the higher revenue from price per unit contracts, reflecting the timing of new game launches. Year-over-year services revenue decreased primarily reflecting the tough comparison with last year's first quarter results, which had benefited from the large Powerball jackpot. The addition of the Arizona Systems contract essentially offset the impact from the expiration of the Indiana Terminal Services Transition Agreement. Now let me turn the call over to Mike.\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: Thanks, KJ. Good afternoon, everyone. Continuing on from gaming and lottery, our interactive segment had another great quarter, revenue was up 33% year-over-year to $96 million and our growth once again exceeded the industry norm on a year-over-year basis. As a result of the strong revenue growth operating income increased $6 million and AEBITDA rose nearly $8 million or 49% compared to the prior year period. The AEBITDA margin increased to 23.9%. While the margin improved it's important to recognize that our interactive business is at an early stage of development and growth. Our original social casino apps, Jackpot Party and Gold Fish continue to provide double-digit growth and we have expanded our offering with the addition of new casino apps. Leveraging our extensive library of gaming IP and game content, each of these new apps provides differentiation and therefore creates the opportunity to appeal to a broader market and grow our paying customer base. The marketing support to create awareness, the player acquisition cost to build the player base and the prelaunched development investment are the primary drivers behind the increase in SG&A expense in the period. Our interactive B2B business, which includes our game content for real money gaming and our SG Universe social solutions also increased in the quarter. Revenue grew 30% over the prior year period despite the unfavorable impact of about $1 million of foreign currency exchange. At the corporate level, operating expense increased as the benefit from lower payroll cost was offset by higher legal costs. Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased $10 million to $111 million, which included $13 million of cash payments related to the business improvement initiatives we implemented in the fourth quarter. Changes in working capital contributed $7 million to cash flow compared to $19 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow was essentially flat year-over-year as the $10 million increase in operating cash flow was largely offset by $10 million in capital expenditures. Midway through the first quarter, we completed a very successful refinancing. Since we've previously discussed this, I won't rehash it in detail. In summary, as a result of the refinancing transactions, we lowered our cash interest, reduced our exposure to variable interest rates, extended our maturities and paid off the $45 million outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. Given the refinancing occurred midway through the quarter, our interest expense for the period reflected about half of the benefit. We recorded a $29.7 million charge for the extinguishment and modification of debt related to the refinancing transactions. During the quarter, we also completed the $21.5 million acquisition of DEQ, which was funded from operating cash flow. And we incurred about $3 million of acquisition related expense included in restructuring and other which was an add back to AEBITDA. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $17 million during the first quarter. In early April we used available cash on hand to fund the acquisition of Spicerack Media into our interactive business, which is immediately accretive to our earnings and operating cash flow. Going forward, our primary goal remains to create operating improvements and opportunities that will enable us to further reduce leverage. And now I'd like to open up the call for questions, operator?\n",
      "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen at this time we'll open the floor to questions. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Barry Jonas from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Barry Jonas: Hi guys, just a couple from me. Kevin, is there still room to cut cost out of the business or is your focus not really more on driving the top-line?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: I think we have to be measured, but there is still a solid opportunity as we get through quarter-by-quarter. This is something that I think is going to be not big amounts in any particular point in time, but just operational excellence and scale benefits as we get moving. So it should be accretive benefits every quarter.\n",
      "Barry Jonas: Great. And then you guys have been exploring ways to monetize your interactive business since I think September. Just wondering where you are in that process, and maybe some general thoughts about the double down sale?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yes I'm not sure we're actually -- we're not looking to do anything aggressively at all. We have a great business that's growing phenomenally well. We've got the best in class management team, we've got very creative development people in that business. And we see a long runway of growth. However, just when you talk about the double down and another great competitor. And when you look at the multiple that that business was able to achieve. And you look at the trajectory of what we are accomplishing I think that bodes well for us and I'll leave it at that.\n",
      "Barry Jonas: Great, and if I could just ask one last one. I think game apps was maybe one part of the report where we saw a little bit of contraction. Just curious where we are in the cycle there and if you think stabilization is near?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yes, I think I am little disappoint to be honest with the performance in the first quarter and we have in our hands kind of approach on that right now. And we believe that the Gamescape success and making sure of our sales team understands the power of what it's been accomplishing, where it's been launched. Is a great story to tell to everyone that hasn't brought the games yet and we feel that we have got an improving trend as we go through the remaining quarters of the year.\n",
      "Barry Jonas: Great, thanks so much.\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: You welcome.\n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Wieczynski from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Steven Wieczynski: Hey, good afternoon guys. So I guess first on the slot side of things. Obviously you had a really strong quarter for the for sale products and you obviously benefited from some new properties, but as we look at the replacement, the replacements were essentially they are up slightly just pretty much flattish. And I guess the question is, what are you hearing from your customers in terms of replacement spending as given how we are seeing some upticks here in some of these regional markets. Are any of your customers are thinking about getting a little bit more aggressive on the replacement side of things?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: I think it's a little early to say that we are seeing that, but just start to sense a feeling that with the seizure situation starting to move into the past and the reinvestment cycle starting to be more obvious and the economic situation starting to modestly improve that we're cautiously optimistic that things will be a little bit better than the neutral that you are referring to, but let's wait and see.\n",
      "Steven Wieczynski: Okay, got you. And then going to the interactive side of things, I know a couple of your competitors out there said acquisition cost have started to pick up a little bit in a space. Is that something that you guys are seeing are you being pretty rationale in terms of what you willing to spend?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: I think if you look at the results, it speaks for itself and I would say that this is the thing why I said we have a management team that I believe is really, really top notch and we are paying for leads that are -- that have a return on them. So I think our guys are very disciplined. So I don't see any change in that trend.\n",
      "Steven Wieczynski: Okay, got you. And the one quick question, not sure if you will answer this or not. But obviously your stock is in a very positive more here in the last six months or so and I guess with your leverage still being pretty high at this point. Is there any thought in terms of potentially using equity to drive down leverage at some point?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: No I think we feel very confident, our management team here feel some power to drive the business forward and have no interest in doing that at this point. Not to say that things don't change but right now we feel very confident with our position and where we are going. And would rather see us ourselves delever, the old fashion way.\n",
      "Steven Wieczynski: Okay, great. Thanks Kevin, appreciate it.\n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from David Katz from Telsey Advisor Group. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "David Katz: Hi, afternoon. And I wanted to follow-up on the social rather interactive aspect of the business. Can you talk a little bit clearly you have a long runway within I believe is what your comment was. Can you talk about the dual aspects of that on the one side being a B2B and the other being B2C and how you see those evolving when you indicate you had a long runway for them?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yeah I think each one is -- you're exactly right it's a little bit of a different story. On the B2C we have got -- one of the things when I came in was we don't know where we are going with the business let's always be thoughtful about the alternatives whether somebody comes along and wants to offer some fortune which we are not interested in right now or we go and say, hey, you got the track for the future for an IPO. So we always want to be looking at that growth rate and the way we see the business today we have a phenomenal opportunities going forward and at these outsized growth rates we want to keep running as fast as we can on that business. And on the B2B you saw the growth there as well and I think we have a compelling preposition and as the operators continue to watch what we are able to accomplish I think that growth continues as well.\n",
      "David Katz: Are there any sort of data points or anecdotal support from customers on that B2B side in terms of what they are looking for or what they aspire too that you as the sort of leader on the enterprise system side can engage with? If you could pull a little more meat on that skeleton?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yes, I think it's the fact that the Scientific Games and our powerful brands have very strong content and making sure we're thoughtful to provide a solution to our customers to enhance their repertoire for their customers is very important to us as well. So I think we're just going to continue to do what we've been doing without getting into the recipe.\n",
      "David Katz: Very good. And if I can just ask one more detail, is there any sort of update on your CapEx expectations for this year and any qualitative thoughts you can give me around '18 would be helpful as well? And that's it from me.\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: Sure, it's Mike Quartieri. No, in the press release we reaffirmed our original guidance between $280 million to $310 million. And I think that would a consistent expectation. I think every year going out unless there is a major system project on the lottery side that we would need to fund.\n",
      "David Katz: Got it, thank you very much.\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: You're welcome.\n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Malouf from Craig-Hallum Capital. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Mike Malouf: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Hate to keep harping on interactive, but when you take a look at the EBITDA multiples I mean the EBITDA percentage that you have this quarter obviously up from last year. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense of since in this growth phase currently, what is the potential for EBITDA margins in interactive, is it as profitable as the other parts of the business?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: I think we have -- we can't talk about forward-looking stuff, but I would say that Mike's commentary earlier on is really if you think about it as we become bigger and we have more games launched, the marketing associated with the new games becomes a lesser factor as you think about it in '18 and '19 et cetera. So, with that I think we are all confident that the margins will continue to grow. If we were to stop investing in the future, we have much higher margins, but that would be with the secret formula we have right now that wouldn't make any sense. So we're going to build that business very carefully and grow the margins, but also be thoughtful about making sure we've got the next big thing coming down the path.\n",
      "Mike Malouf: Okay, great. And any plans in the near future or even perhaps in the next 12 months for further refinances with regards to the debt?\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: No, I think we're just going to continue to watch the markets and take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves.\n",
      "Mike Malouf: Okay, great. Thanks.\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Of course we will. We're going to be smart about it of course.\n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Staph [ph] from Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can I guess expand your thoughts as you think about machine sales segment you had an extra ordinary growth in first quarter I know a lot of that kind of extra ordinary growth was from the Ilani. And I guess how do you think about this business going forward? And your story obviously has a number of moving pieces. So I wanted to see if you're comfortable to the extent you can help us bracket ship share I guess if you look at your stock and you look at your operational turnaround past year or so, you have been able to stabilized that declining ship share and I guess as of the end of the year it was kind of maybe 27%, 28%. The first quarter I guess in theory would go up given the outstanding performance and I was wondering where you think you can take that again just trying to think about the pathway and what you could actually do with the gaming unit segment?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yes, I think at the end of the day the market share gain is got to be very capital, because that's usually not a winning proposition. The success of this brand and the other brands we compete with very good companies is the success of the games that you produce and we've got a lot of effort as you guys know in R&D to make sure we're thoughtful about the games that are coming out so that we continue to attract the attention of all the casino operators because if you have a successful platform you're going to sell the product, and that's critically important to us. So that coupled with the signing of just as an example, I believe we have this unprecedented opportunity with the signing of James Bond and having the right stall of the movies and all the Bond characters and all the Bond ladies and all the characteristics and you think about Bond and what that has done for the gaming industry, there is always a couple of scenes there. So it's incumbent on us as an organization to make sure that we are being very thoughtful about this as we look to the next generation of gaming and trying to be on that cutting edge to say, hey, here is some new thoughts and new thinking. And I think we've got a lot of effort right now going on into making sure we're being thoughtful about that and creative to ensure that we're taking full advantage of that signing as an example.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: And I guess can you talk about maybe the Ilani as a case study about, what were some of the things that contributed obviously you're getting such a high share and whether or not you can replicate that elsewhere?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yes I mean I think it gets back to content. And I think we have a great reputation in that market and the success. So beyond that I don't think we want to get into.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.\n",
      "Operator: And ladies and gentlemen our final question for the day comes from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Chad Beynon: Great, thanks for taking my question. Mike you finished your response for the CapEx with unless there is another lottery big CapEx. And I wanted to kind of poker that for a second, we've read that in Italy there could be discussion of pulling forward the instant ticket contract which is a very profitable you had a very expensive one. Could you just help us think about I guess what's out there in the press anything legislatively and then more importantly, if this is pulled forward how you would value that versus some of your other opportunities? Thanks.\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: Obviously Italy is a key market for us from an instant product side. So we're going to do whatever we need to do to make that we maintain that position and maintain that revenue and EBITDA growth for our company. In regards to really other CapEx items, I think the next line of contracts that are really coming up we've already talked about the Maryland System contract moving forward at this point. There is legislative meetings taking place in May which we're hope that the contract gets signed at that point. Pennsylvania is out for until the end of '18. Italy will be out till 2019, so at this point those are the three main contracts that we have we would be looking for to make that type of large scale investment in.\n",
      "Chad Beynon: Okay. And you haven't heard anything from legislatively from the Italian representatives or your contacts there that this could potentially be pulled forward I guess that was the first part of my question on that.\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: No, not at this point.\n",
      "Chad Beynon: Okay thanks. And then just switching gears to the Spicerack acquisition, this complements a lot of your home grown games. Are there any other segments with also kind of within social gambling where you think you could add on to kind of bulk up your overall offerings to customers? And that's it from me.\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Sure and obviously we're not going to get specific on that. But I would tell you that we have our eyes out to make sure that we'd be thoughtful when something like that comes along. This acquisition I believe is going to turn out to be a fantastic one for us. And if you look at the business model of the number one and the number two player in that space, you'll see what they did once they expanded the reach of the Bingo with the introduction of some gaming within in that proposition. So those are the kinds of the things thinking out of the box to kind a create the incremental value is what would get us interested.\n",
      "Chad Beynon: Okay, thank you very much.\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Okay\n",
      "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen at this time, now we will conclude our question-and-answer session.\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Thanks so much, I appreciate that. Thanks for joining us this afternoon guys. And 2017 has started well, we are building momentum and we are excited about our prospects for growth and improvement during the year.

       "\"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zions Bancorporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, James Abbott.\\nJames Abbott: Thanks, John, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2010 earnings results. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call. And if you do not yet have a copy of the press release, it is available as an Adobe Acrobat file at zionsbancorporation.com. We will limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions. I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Harris?\\nH. Simmons: Thank you very much, James, and thanks to all of you who are listening in. We are generally quite pleased with the events of the fourth quarter. The big story this quarter is a strong improvement in credit quality. That's a trend that's been developing since really back in the spring of last year, but certainly accelerated toward the end of the year. We made some very strong efforts during the fourth quarter to resolve a significant amount of problem credits. As a result, we were able to reduce classified loans by over $1 billion, a 23% reduction over the three-month period of the fourth quarter. Due to the new disclosures required by the SEC regarding our allowance for credit losses, which will show up in our 10-K and subsequent filings, we are disclosing our classified loan balances this quarter and expect to continue doing so going forward. If you're not familiar with the definition of a classified loan, we have included a definition in the footnote at the end of the text in the press release. We'd note that the classified loans that we're reflecting here are, in large part in fact, over 2/3 of them, are actually current. And yet these are the population of commercial and real estate credits primarily in which we see continuing stress. But that number is coming down rather dramatically during the fourth quarter. Most of these loans were resolved in a manner favorable to the company and the shareholders through, for example, payoffs and paydowns, upgrades to passed grades, which together greatly exceeded charge-offs. Notably, we didn't do any bulk sales of problem credits at deep discounts to achieve this reduction in problem credits. And other credit quality metrics showed similar improvement including non-performing loans, other real estate owned balances and expenses attributable to other real estate owned. We did experience a slightly higher level of net loan charge-offs compared to the prior quarter, largely reflective of the number and dollar amount of problem loans that we resolved. While we don't expect to experience as rapid a decline in classified loans in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to see significant improvement. We also expect net charge-offs to decline significantly in the first quarter. A lower level of classified loans, together with our expectation that loan quality will continue to improve, our expectation of a lower-level of loan charge-offs going forward, obviously, have favorable implications for the likely amount of loan loss provision that we may have to make in future quarters. As we look at various macroeconomic trends within our footprint, we remain quite encouraged with various market data emerging from our major markets. Specifically, we are seeing some continuing signs that rental income is stabilizing across our footprint. And in some cases, we're seeing increases in rental rates, particularly in the Houston, Orange County and San Diego markets. Vacancy trends are improving across majority of our property types in our footprint. And further, we are pleased with continued steadiness in cap rates during the last several months. All of these factors should facilitate faster problem credit resolution and improving loan growth. Finally, I'd like to note the emerging growth in commercial and industrial loans, which increased at a 5% annualized rate compared to the prior quarter. Production volume and particularly, C&I volume, increased significantly. And we expect an even stronger first quarter as our pipelines continue to strengthen. So with that overview, on the credit front, I'm going to ask Doyle Arnold, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, to review the rest of the numbers. Doyle?\\nDoyle Arnold: Thank you, Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. As noted in the release, we posted a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $110.3 million or $0.62 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter. However, excluding the non-cash sub debt amortization and FDIC loan discount accretion, the loss improved to $0.25 per share from $0.30 a share in the prior quarter. As Harris has already covered credit quality, I'll highlight two other key areas: revenue in the income statement, one; and capital, second. And then we'll take your questions. If you want additional detail on credit quality, and I know that many of you do, there's additional information on Pages 13, 14 and 15 in the press release. And we'll be happy to cover more detail in the questions. First, looking at revenue drivers on Page 16. The GAAP NIM, net interest margin, compressed 35 basis points to 3.49% from 3.84% in the prior quarter. The core NIM, which excludes amortization of sub debt and items related to FDIC loan outperformance, actually expanded four basis points to 4.07%. There is a reconciliation to that GAAP NIM and the non-GAAP core NIM on Page 17 and also a reconciliation of the earnings per share GAAP, non-GAAP on Page 17. I will note once again that I think the published estimates for our NIM range from 3.3% to nearly 4.1% this quarter. We published, in an IR conference in New York on December 7, that we thought the NIM would be 3.40% to 3.50% on a reported basis and that core NIM remains strong. The 3.49% was within and right at the top end of the range that we announced and I think we had given relatively guidance for at least a month prior to that December 7 presentation. So once again, I would urge you to, around the time that we announced the amount of sub debt converting into preferred, and that will occur around February 15 this quarter, to pay careful attention to what we say in that 8-K because we'll try to quantify the impact; and take a look at whatever our first IR presentation is after that because we do try to lay this out there for you. The adverse impact of subordinated debt amortization is really important on the GAAP number. It was 74 basis points this quarter compared to 35 basis points in the prior quarter. And that's solely because of the larger amount of sub debt converting this quarter compared to last quarter. Note that a lot of this impact shows up as the cost of long-term debt, which on a GAAP basis jumped to 25%. You'll see that on Page 16 about a quarter of the way up from the bottom. Long-term debt, $1.95 billion, with a 25.16% average GAAP rate. That's obviously not the rate we're paying on that debt, but it does reflect the cost of this discount amortization. The yield on loans was generally stable. Excluding FDIC-supported loans, loan yield declined four basis points to 4.56% [sic] (5.56%] from 5.60%. We continue to see slow downward pressure on loans. More about that later. During the quarter, we continued to make progress in lowering interest-bearing deposit costs, which declined seven basis points to 0.59% from 0.66%. And we also partly -- part of that was achieved by reducing balances in the more expensive deposit categories such as CDs. Loan attrition more than offset the deposit declines, and thus average cash and securities balances increased somewhat. Average cash remained at a relatively high percentage of total earnings assets at 11%, which by our calculation, pressured the NIM by more than 30 basis points compared to historical norms. We will continue to try to reduce our excess liquidity during the next several months, partially through additional deposit attrition. Although the number of levers that we have yet available to pull there's diminishing to a relatively few. But we do, as Harris said, I believe, that the rate of loan runoff and/or later in the year, loan growth will begin to moderate the buildup in excess liquidity. In addition to excess cash balances, the NIM was pressured by approximately 20 basis points due to the level of non-accrual assets and interest reversals as loans moved into non-accrual. A significant drag, but it is a bit lower than last quarter because of non-accrual balances as Harris already mentioned came down. Finally, our balance sheet does remain asset sensitive. Although for several months now, we have been taking measures to keep it from becoming even more so. In other words, we're trying to hold it at a reasonable level and not just let nature take its course. The other key component of revenue is our earning asset base, and loans are an important component of that. On Page 12, as mentioned in the release, construction and land development loans declined by $639,000,000, which accounted for the vast majority of total loan balance declines. There's little demand for this product at this time, and we expect some C&D loans to continue to decline over the next few quarters. Although you will note that the amount of decline in the fourth quarter was meaningfully bigger than it had been in any prior quarters.  So I may -- time will tell whether that reflects our and our borrowers' balance sheet cleanup efforts. We've had an unusually large amount of reduction. FDIC-supported loans also declined by $119 million, as we continue to work through that portfolio with continued results that are generally better than initially modeled. C&I loans, as Harris mentioned, increased $121 million or 1.3% sequentially or a bit over 5% annualized after several quarters of moderating declines. Nearly all of our affiliate banks experienced growth in this category, with Amegy Bank in Texas being the strongest performer. And as we've discussed, borrower demand with our bankers around the franchise, we do get the sense that loan demand is now continuing to strengthen and is becoming more widespread geographically. Overall loan production increased significantly while yields on new loans did decline. But spreads do remain above spreads over [indiscernible] cost of funds do remain above pre-crisis levels. Shifting to the income statement on Page 11. I'm going to go through a few, more technical items to make sure you understand some quarter-over-quarter comparisons and single out some lumpy items or things that move around so you can build your thoughts about ongoing run rates accordingly. First for those who are comparing the prior quarter's release or numbers in your models, we did make a $5 million reclassification to the prior quarter's numbers, $5 million moved from capital markets and foreign exchange income, the fourth line under non-interest income, down another three lines to fair value and non-hedged derivative income. So if you go back to our prior release, the $8 million was $13 million and this $16.7 million was $21.7 million. So net bottom line impact, zero. We just moved that $5 million around as it related to favorable marks in the prior quarter on certain securities that were purchased for asset liability management purposes. Secondly, I want to note that securities impairment costs declined again to $12.3 million, down from nearly $24 million in the prior quarter and nearly $100 million a year ago. And I'd also note that less than half of that $12 million this quarter was related to bank and insurance trust preferred CDOs. On the first line under non-interest income, service charges fees on deposit accounts. I'm going to compare this quarter to the second quarter and note that there was about a $5.4 million decline or $21 million to $22 million annualized. That reflects changes to the rules governing NSF fees. And I took you all the way back to the second quarter because the implementing regulation took place in the middle of the third quarter so a comparison of June to December probably better reflects the run rate impact of this change, a bit more than $20 million annually. Fair value and non-hedged income, our non-hedged derivative income line was essentially zero for the quarter after showing a negative $17 million in the prior quarter. Recall that the prior quarter included the negative initial valuation on the total return swap as we discussed in detail on the October earnings call. As a reminder, assuming that we keep the total return swap in place, the next expense on this line for the TRS would occur in the third quarter of this year, that is 2011, at an amount of approximately $5.3 million. Then as discussed in the prior earnings call, fixed income securities line in the third quarter, which showed $8.4 million, contained income that was related to the repurchase at par by a global investment bank, some auction rate securities that we held on our balance sheet at a discount to par. We had purchased those back from our customers when the market became totally illiquid. Repurchases of ARS in the fourth quarter were immaterial. Also in the prior quarter, other non-interest income included $13.8 million from the sale of net deposits. So of that $20.2 million line, $13.8 million was a onetime gain on the sale of a subsidiary, just to refresh your memory. Moving now to non-interest expenses. The provision for unfunded lending commitments is probably the most unusual item there. It increased to $14 million, actually $13.8 million from a little over $1 million in the prior quarter. This is due to the way we assign allowance for credit loss to loan pools. In the fourth quarter, we experienced a loss on an energy loan in Texas that was downgraded to substandard, incidentally unrelated to the Gulf oil spill. That caused loss factors to increase for all other loans of that energy type. And a number of our energy credits have significant unfunded balances. Thus, a portion of the expense went through provisions for unfunded commitments, while any change in the provision line only covered the outstanding balances.  I'll also note the meaningful drop in other real estate expense from $44 million to $25 million that Harris mentioned earlier. We're pleased to have achieved that, even as we had a substantial drop in OREO balances. The other non-interest expense line declined by about $9 million. And recall, the third quarter number had a onetime expense. This was the restructuring fee for the total return swap paid once and only once, and that was $11.6 million. So if you adjust for that in the third quarter, the change was relatively small compared to the fourth. I'll just note that in the press release on Page 4, there is a table, again, that we've used a couple of quarters now, trying to simplify your way through the incredibly arcane accounting for these loans. And we think the net revenue and expense effect of these FDIC-supported assets is about a favorable $3.8 million pretax this quarter, which is similar to the prior quarter. Shifting to a discussion of capital briefly. During the quarter, we issued $118 million of new common equity raised through our ongoing distribution program, which slightly more than offset the $110 million GAAP net loss to common. And that, along with some reduction in risk-weighted assets as well as a reduction in disallowed deferred tax asset, resulted in a substantial further improvement in our Tier 1 common ratio, which seems to be the ratio of choice, or focus, these days. And we currently estimate that it was 9.08% at quarter end, up from 8.66% in the prior quarter. And I'll note that it's 35% higher than it was one year ago when the ratio was 6.73%, so pretty significant improvement from 6.73% to 9.08%. Some guidance for the next few quarters. We expect the overall balance sheet size for the year will net out to probably around flat. There may be some loan shrinkage earlier in the year still, but followed by some loan growth later in the year. So basically we think the net shrinkage in the loan portfolio will begin to moderate as demand for C&I and term CRE; and to some extent, consumer loans appears to be strengthening. And we do expect that at some point the C&D loan runoff will begin to moderate. So net-net, our crystal ball is not sufficiently clear to forecast exactly when the growth categories will offset the attritting categories, result in loan growth, but sometime during the middle half of the year would be the best rough guess. We would expect the core net interest margin to remain generally stable during the next several quarters. If loan balances continue to attrit, we expect to deploy some of the incremental cash into a modest amount of securities in medium term duration, thereby mitigating the impact on the NIM. But this will not be material amounts as best we forecast at the moment. Deals on new loan production are now below or somewhat dilutive to the average yield on the portfolio. However, new loan production continues to be accretive to the margin as our cost of incremental funding remains very low.  Additionally, we still have some availability to reduce deposit costs. And long term, we think we do remain well positioned for rising interest rates. Finally, credit quality. Obviously, the most significant factor in returning to profitability is credit costs. The total provisions were $187 million this quarter. And we expect those charge-offs to decline fairly significantly over the next few quarters, driven by improving fundamentals along our borrowers. And we expect non-accrual loans and other adversely-rated loans will continue to recede at a healthy pace, although not perhaps quite at the pace of the fourth quarter, which reflected a very hard push to reduce these problem loans. Therefore as the economy continues to show some reasonably stable improvement, we would expect both charge-offs and provisions to decline meaningfully from third and fourth quarter levels as we go into the first quarter and through 2011. With that, operator, I think we are ready to queue up questions and we'll be happy to try to respond.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first coming from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.\\nSteven Alexopoulos: We've only had a couple of banks report so far, but some of them have had very sharp declines in provision, like 40%, 50%. Do you guys think maybe you're a quarter behind this because of the classified load in workout? And then you could see a drop in that range? Or is that too much because you're continuing to work out these classified loans? I guess I'm trying to size this term meaningfully.\\nH. Simmons: Based on what we see now, it's going to be meaningful. We just don't see anything close to this level of charge-offs coming through in the first quarter that we've been experiencing for the last year now, kind of in the 240 to 250 range on average. Our current thinking is you're not going to see a zero provision from us or a negative provision from us. There's not going to be a huge reserve release. But if you have a significant decline in charge-offs and a continued decline in classifieds, it would not be unreasonable to expect a continued underprovision of roughly the kind of magnitude, dollar magnitude that we've had the last couple of quarters now. So you've got charge-offs declining, and you could get that provision down quite significantly and still not be just bleeding lots of reserves out. And I'm not going to try to quantify it. We've just been -- we don't want to declare victory here too early, but things are looking pretty good right now.\\nSteven Alexopoulos: Based on where credit and capital ended the year and where they're trending, do you think there's any real chance you could have TARP repayment discussions in the first half of the year? Or realistically, is this a second half event?\\nH. Simmons: I suspect my regulators are actually listening in. They don't have a microphone. But my own expectation would be that we could start having more -- as I said, I've been saying this now probably since around late third quarter or early fourth, that I thought that if classified levels came down materially and the trends were still positive, if earnings were positive, at least before TARP dividends, and for us, there's this kind of added question of how do they and we think about the non-cash charges, which are volatile and can be high related to the sub debt conversion. But anyway, I think those two trends are clearly in place, i.e. earnings improvement, loan quality improvement and capital ratios having significantly improved, that we should -- we'll at least start to ask in the second quarter if we can have those discussions. We are, as always, mindful of approaching TARP repayment in the most intelligent way possible. And we're not, as I've said before, totally fixated on the idea that we have to do whatever it takes to pay it off all at once. We may do it over a few quarters. But again, all of that subject to discussion with the guys listening on the phone and maybe some of their friends in Washington.\\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Zabora from Stifel, Nicolaus.\\nBrian Zabora: You gave us before the [indiscernible] of that loan loss reserve. Do you have that number this quarter?\\nDoyle Arnold: Well, first of all, the numbers aren't exactly comparable as we will discuss in greater detail in our 10-Q. We've changed our quantitative methodology this quarter to capture -- make sure that we keep them in the rearview mirror. And firmly in the calculation, the loss impact from the 12 to 18 months ago losses, which were much higher. So in other words, we had been taking the higher of six or 12 months losses by loan grade category, bank, et cetera. We've extended that back to six, 12 or 18 months. And that change soaked up some of the qualitative reserves, if you will. But I think there's still about even with that change, there's a pretty large qualitative factor, $300 million to.\\nH. Simmons: About $280 million.\\nDoyle Arnold: Pretty significant qualitative adjustments.\\nBrian Zabora: And just remind us the DTA decision at this point.\\nDoyle Arnold: DTA, on a GAAP basis, was $555 million at year end. That's down from $585 million the prior quarter. The regulatory disallowed DTA included in risk-based capital on a consolidated basis is approximately $121 million this quarter, down from $179 million in the prior quarter. The balance sheet earnings do not reflect any GAAP reserve against the deferred tax asset.\\nOperator: We will take our next question coming from Christopher Nolan from CRT Capital.\\nChristopher Nolan: Could you go through the remaining balance for the subordinated debt that's eligible for conversion into preferred stock?\\nH. Simmons: The amount -- well, there is $800 million in total. One of three issues has the option this quarter. It's the roughly similar size. So the amount that could elect this quarter is probably in the $200 million range, maybe a bit more. I'm not -- if we can come up with a precise number on the call, we'll get it. But that will be...\\nDoyle Arnold: Chris, I'm showing about $330 million actually. This is the larger of the three issues. Except when you think about it, two of the issues convert in the second and fourth quarters. And that sum would be about $470 million that's remaining eligible to convert. That's why the second and fourth quarter are a little bit larger or could be a little bit larger conversion.\\nChristopher Nolan: So James, the total amount conversion right now is $470 million you just mentioned or is it larger?\\nJames Abbott: The amount that could elect this quarter is $330 million. We won't know until about February 15 how much did elect. That's when the elections become irrevocable. And realistically, we don't really get a sense -- most of these elections come in the last couple of the days, so we have no kind of early indication right now to offer you.\\nChristopher Nolan: The aggregate amount including the $330 million would be somewhere around $800 million, if I understood Doyle correctly?\\nJames Abbott: That's correct. It's just over $800 million, I think, $804 million, something like that.\\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Bob Patten from Morgan Keegan.\\nRobert Patten: Can you give us some color around the NPA sales and break down charge-offs between what were charge-offs? And are the charge-offs related to the sales? What kind of marks you guys took? And since you didn't do a bulk sale, give us an idea of what kind of sales you did do?\\nH. Simmons: The old-fashioned way, one at a time. I mean, we did post some repossessed smaller commercial properties on our auction site and participated in the auction of about 70 properties. And we took -- we accepted bids on some of those, we rejected bids on others. But they were individual buyers. There wasn't an offer that's a take-one, take-all kind of a thing. And then we subsequently worked out a number of them, and we didn't take from the auction one at a time. So no bulk sales. I don't know. Do you have a non-accrual resolution?  I've got a classified loan resolution. Do you have that, James?\\nJames Abbott: Sure. On the non-accrual, the loans that were moved back to accrual status were about $133 million. The amount of non-accrual loans that paid off or paid down was about $290 million, $285 million. And then we moved to about a little over $100 million to OREO for the quarter. And then there were charge-offs obviously.\\nRobert Patten: Can you then give me an idea of what the charge-off related to loan sales specifically were?\\nDoyle Arnold: I don't think we have that. We resolved a lot of problem credits without increasing net charge-offs much above where they were last time. And we resolved -- we net reduced OREO by, I think, around $50 million, if memory serves me. Let me see here, yes, $305 million down to $260 million. So about $45 million, which is a pretty meaningful percentage. And yet OREO expense declines, as I mentioned earlier, from about $44 million down to $25 million or $26 million. So the loss severity did not increase materially over what we have been experiencing in order to move a massive amount of problem credits in OREO this quarter.\\nKenneth Peterson: And Doyle, this is Ken Peterson, the Chief Credit Officer. Anecdotally, there were a number of transactions in which we actually experienced gains from the sale of OREO for the first time.\\nOperator: Our next question coming from Joe Morford from RBC Capital.\\nJoe Morford: I'm just curious, the available-for-sale securities portfolio was up almost $1 billion or so this quarter, 28%. What was driving that and what exactly are you buying? And just thoughts around the securities portfolio in general?\\nH. Simmons: It's a pretty straightforward answer, but I'll let David Hemingway get it.\\nW. Hemingway: $700 million of the increase was actually excess cash at the holding company that we moved into a separate account in purchased Treasury bills in anticipation. That's half the amount of TARP that we'd like to pay back. And so that $700 million is sitting in Treasury bills, ready for the Treasury whenever they're willing to take it. The other increase was in fact, we purchased some Fannie and Freddie five-year ARMs, a couple of hundred million dollars for the banks. And these are underlying as floating rate, but agency ARMS.\\nJoe Morford: And then the other question was just can you quantify the impact of the Durbin amendment at all related here?\\nH. Simmons: We have. The approximate gross impact would be about $50 million annually. And as you're hearing from others, we are very focused on various strategies to help us recapture a substantial portion of that through repricing of accounts, et cetera, et cetera. But that's still a little premature.\\nOperator: And we'll take our last question from Craig Siegenthaler from Crédit Suisse.\\nCraig Siegenthaler: It sounds like your response to the first question, that the word meaningful in kind of your charge-off deficit [ph] could imply pre-TARP dividend profitability in the first half. Is this fair? Or am I just kind of getting a little aggressive here?\\nH. Simmons: It could imply that. Again I mean, particularly if you're willing to exclude the non-cash impact of the sub debt conversion costs, which ironically the more things improve, it may be that more people are willing to do that conversion which actually trashes the GAAP earnings. But we have no way to know that. But if you've set that aside, then I would not argue with your premise.\\nCraig Siegenthaler: And in your discussion with regulators, do they exclude the non-cash charges? And also are they looking at your earnings result x the TARP dividend?\\nH. Simmons: Well, I think they're struggling with that is the best answer I can give, particularly knowing that Charlie is on the line. I do think they're struggling with that. I think they do understand that that's somehow different and reflects an ongoing impact of past capital actions and has nothing to do with the fundamental operating income of the company. And at least at some level, they're willing to acknowledge that. But again when you get down to TARP repayment discussions and things like that, I believe that was a component of your question, we haven't -- that's premature. We'll have a little more insight into that next quarter if we are able to then at that time actually sit down and discuss that heavily.\\nCraig Siegenthaler: And Doyle, just once more the kind of CDO losses, they're kind of down here to a low levels. Should it be only kind of a couple more quarters here for CDO to trump losses?\\nDoyle Arnold: I think unless something really dramatic comes out of the woodwork, it's likely that there will be a trickle of these for a while as continued bank closures, but the fundamental trends are good. Most of our losses have been coming out -- the vast majority of the losses have come out of banks that have previously deferred their dividend. And we have modeled anything that's deferred with a very high default probability. And the number of new deferrals has been declining consistently for over a year now and is getting down to lower and lower levels, which portends well for future bank failures. The number of bank failures has peaked and begun to decline. And I believe the FDIC has stated that they expect they have peaked and will decline. The size of the bank failures has dropped dramatically in 2010 compared to what was going on in 2009. Therefore, the amount in our collateral pool is way down. And finally, the percent of failures to which we have exposure has declined from the 45%, 50% range, if we go back two years, to 20%, 25% in more recent quarters. So all of which I think bodes well for future OTTI remaining at pretty low levels, but it may continue for a little while.\\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Erika Penala, Bank of America.\\nErika Penala: My first question is on I guess, thinking in a more normal environment, what place if any, does $1.1 billion in preferred that's yielding 9% have? I mean, I'm thinking as they fully convert, how do you think of that in context of a more normal earnings environment?\\nH. Simmons: Well, as noted in a discussion with investors, and you can certainly get this us out of our SEC filings, our capital structure contains a very high degree of optionality. And once we get past TARP repayment, the things I'm about to mention, we can't do until TARP has been fully repaid. But once it is, in 2012, we have about $150 million of non-cum perpetual preferred with an 11% coupon that is callable in mid-2012. The preferred that you mentioned, the 9 1/2% of preferred, and that's what most of the sub debt that is converting is converting into. That's callable in mid-2013. So I think what you could anticipate is that if capital market conditions are favorable, we would look to restructure our capital to either reduce the total amount of preferred if we didn't need it and/or refinance it with a lower-cost instrument, assuming, in your words, things are more normal out there. So there's a lot of optionality in the capital structure that would allow continued increases in net income to call in, given the same operating performance over the next two and half years.\\nErika Penala: James, I didn't catch how it would be the second half amount is in terms of the sub debt that is eligible for election?\\nJames Abbott: In the current quarter, it's 330-some-odd million dollars. And in the second quarter, it is $470 million is the total eligible pool that may convert.\\nH. Simmons: The two pieces together are $800 million. That's what's left out there that hasn't already converted. And any conversions that happen this quarter will reduce the remaining pool that is eligible to convert.\\nOperator: And our next question is coming from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust.\\nJennifer Demba: On credit, number one, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of where you're seeing the improvement in non-accrual and classified loans by geography? And secondly, on your restructured loans, can you give us a sense of what percentage of restructured loans might be up for review this year and eligible to go back on performing status? And how high would you see that absolute dollar amount being peaking, I guess, during the cycle?\\nH. Simmons: I'll take a swag at your first question, and maybe, Ken, if you want to chime in on restructured loans. I'd tell you the classified loan balances, which probably reflects similar patterns in accruals, et cetera, came down in just about, I think, in every single subsidiary, affiliate bank this quarter. And the trend generally is flat to down for the last three quarters across all those banks. The largest dollar amount of reductions came out of Amegy and Zions First National Bank here in the Intermountain West, but the reductions were noticeable everywhere; and were in all loan types including C&I, including term CRE and including construction and development loans. I'll pause there. Does that address the first part of your question? Ken, do you have any response on the restructured?\\nKenneth Peterson: Just to add to that first question, we've even seen in our worst markets a leveling out of the problems, Nevada and Arizona, in particular. So across the entire footprint, I think trends are improving. In terms of our -- let's just take the classified loan reductions, we have had some marked success in AB note structures this quarter over last quarter, and a number of them still in the process for resolutions. I would expect that there's going to be a continued effort in restructuring, coming up with potential AB note structures during this quarter and next quarter. We do expect the classifieds to come down probably somewhere between 8% and 10% in the first quarter and an additional 5% or better in the second quarter.\\nOperator: And our next question is coming from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.\\nKen Zerbe: First question I had, just in terms of your share issuance, the ATM or the[indiscernible], it looks like you have about $6 million left. Do you guys anticipate an additional capital need going forward such that you may increase the ATM offering?\\nH. Simmons: I think, Kevin [ph], built the Tier 1 common to north of 9%. We're not going to want to see that erode from that level, meaningfully. So there, again, depending upon after-tax and after dividend losses, if any, we could see a need to issue some additional capital. The need to build the capital ratio, we think, is largely behind us; again, subject to any discussions with the regulators about TARP and things of that nature. Whether we would do that in the form of continued ATM or other means, and we do use other means like warrant sales and other things or a combination of things, we haven't yet decided, Ken.\\nKen Zerbe: It looks like you got a little bit less of the tax benefit on your losses this quarter. Anything unusual in the tax rate?\\nH. Simmons: Yes, everything is unusual in the tax rate.  Do you want to take that?\\nDoyle Arnold: Yes, Ken, the primary reason is sub debt conversion, only half of it is tax deductible; the other half is not. So while we initially expected a higher tax benefit rate in the fourth quarter, because there was so much sub debt conversion, the tax rate was not as favorable to us as we had initially expected it. But that's really what's going on.  Just kind of looking out for the year, it's a little bit hard to give guidance on tax rate given the volatility of sub debt conversions and the lack of tax deductibility there. But we think it could be in the 45% to 55% range, depending on sub debt conversion amounts. And there's a lot of subjectivity to that so a big grain of salt.\\nH. Simmons: And again because a chunk of that cost is not tax-deductible, the part that was booked directly to capital as opposed to as a gain comes back without tax benefit when it converts.\\nOperator: Our next question is coming from John Pancari from Evercore Partners.\\nJohn Pancari: Doyle, you mentioned in the discussions around TARP repayment and the potential capital need there. Now that you're north of 9% on Tier 1 common, can you talk about how that discussion with regulators has changed in terms of that potential raise? Are you getting any credit for the amount of ATMs that you've completed to date?\\nDoyle Arnold: I think I said we haven't really had any serious discussions with the regulators about TARP repayment. And my best estimate at the moment is that that's not likely to occur until after first quarter results are announced. So I have no color to offer you, and I wasn't trying to foreshadow anything about initial capital raises in my earlier comment.\\nH. Simmons: Since from the beginning of this cycle, we've raised a new common equity issuance, about $1.65 billion in common equity and about another $400 million in preferred, so it has been a meaningful change in capital. And so we would hope and expect that, that would be taken into account as we have those discussions.\\nJohn Pancari: On terms of loan growth, I know you mentioned that you expect it to be flat for the year, and that you could see it down at first and then a pick up. Can you talk about the timing of that inflection point, and give us just an idea in terms of your pipeline and your utilization rate on the commercial side?\\nDoyle Arnold: Pipeline continues to strengthen pretty much across the franchise, particularly in C&I lending, some term CRE lending and some consumer categories. Again, by far the biggest runoff is C&D loans. If we didn't have that drag, loans would've been flat this quarter even with the work out of the FDIC loans. So we do expect that -- C&I loans do seem to be picking up as we got later in the last quarter, in the first part of this quarter. And it kind of when the line crosses [ph], it's going to be dependent on when the C&D runoff abates. Personally, I can't see it continuing in anything like the level of the fourth quarter. If it did, our C&D balances will be zero in the first quarter of 2012. And I don't think that'll happen, but there'll probably be some additional attrition. So I don't know that inflection point, but I would guess there might be modest shrinkage this quarter turning flattish in the middle part of the year and positive sometime in the second half of the year.\\nH. Simmons: I'll just add a little bit of historical data to help a little bit, perhaps, is on the C&I front. We did produce about $1 billion worth of new credit there this quarter. That's up from less than $500 million last quarter, so more than double the production. And it takes a little while for those lines of credit to be utilized to their full degree. Line of credit utilization did decline a couple of percentage points to about 37% or so, 36 point something or other, and I think it rounds to 37%. So as those new lines of credit -- as we see draws upon those new lines of credit, rather then we'll start to see improving balance there. Term commercial real estate production was about 30% better than it was in the prior quarter. Owner-occupied production was similar to the prior quarter. So we are seeing some good production there. And we do have a fair amount of construction loans that are cash flowing, so there may be some conversion in there where we'd see production from that, too. It's about 40 or so percent, we estimate, is cash flowing. The 1:1 debt coverage ratio of our construction portfolio.\\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Marty Mosby from Guggenheim.\\nMarty Mosby: I wanted to focus on maybe a little bit different angle. Something you'd talked about with the macro economic kind of in your region, really starting to improve and starting to hit some favorable strides. And then you kind of let it out there that the pipeline going into the first quarter was stronger than it was going into the fourth quarter when we started to see at least some C&I kind of growth. Can you quantify how much larger the pipeline is and give us a little bit more feel on the traction that you're feeling in your regional and economic areas?\\nDoyle Arnold: I don't know. We don't have a consolidated pipeline that we monitor here, centrally. That's really done at the individual banks. So what we do is we have monthly calls with them about their largest problem credits, but also generally about loan pipeline; how it's developing, what's happening in their market. And it's from those calls kind of every month over the last few months that we just get a sense that month by month by month, those pipelines are incrementally improving. And in the case of C&I, at a fairly decent rate. I can't quantify it for you. There was another part -- the economic conditions around. Harris gave some statistics, kind of real estate related, I think, in general, in most markets there's either some bottoming or slight pick up in economic activity. I think that's true in Texas, it's true here in the Intermountain West and Southern California where most of our exposure is. Things seem to be improving a bit. Nevada, much less so. That's just going to be a very long term workout in Southern Nevada; measured in years, not quarters. And Arizona somewhere in between.\\nH. Simmons: Let's say even the bottom market, their pace of resolution has really picked up and that seems to be continuing. So I think it's clearly been the toughest market for us.\\nJames Abbott: I think, John, that'll probably have to be our last question today. We're out of time. But I do have the list of those who are still in the queue, and I would give you a call back as soon as I can tonight. And I'll be around until everybody gets a call. So we thank you for you time and participation today. And we will see you at the next Investor Relations conference or the next conference call.\\nH. Simmons: Next week for some of you, probably. We'll be back on the East Coast so look forward to it.\\nJames Abbott: Thank you.\\nOperator: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.\""

       "\"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy's Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2011. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Bill Seymour, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\\nBill Seymour: Thank you, Alicia. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in our fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. We have three speakers for you today: Brian Dunn, our CEO; Mike Vitelli, our Co-President of the Americas; and Jim Muehlbauer, our CFO. And after our prepared remarks, I anticipate we will have plenty of time for your questions. Before I pass the call over to Brian, I'd like to take care of a few housekeeping items. First, we would like to request that callers limit themselves to a single question so that we can include more people in our Q&A session. And as usual, the media are participating in this call in a listen-only mode. Let me remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Best Buy may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. I'd also like to remind you that Best Buy will be having an Analyst Investor Day at its corporate campus on April 14. If you would like to register for this event or need further information, please contact Investor Relations. For those of you that cannot make it in person, the event will be webcast and available on our IR site. You will also note that our reported results this morning included detailed information regarding the impact of the restructuring activities we announced on February 22. I ask that you please refer to our earnings release to understand how our announced restructuring affected our fourth quarter year-end financial results within our Domestic and International segments and across the company as a whole. The adjusted numbers we will be discussing today do not include these charges. It should not be confused with the GAAP numbers we reported this morning in our earnings release and the GAAP numbers we will report in our 10-K. For a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supplemental schedule on Page 12 of this morning's news release. With those housekeeping items aside, I would like to turn the call over to Brian Dunn.\\nBrian Dunn: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Before we begin today's discussion, I want to pause and reflect on the horrific events in Japan. We've all been moved by the pictures of destruction in that country, and our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the people of Japan and the many vendor partners and friends of Best Buy who live and work there. Since the tsunami struck on March 11, we have been in close contact with our business partners in Japan and they know that we will support them to the best of our ability as they work to recover and rebuild from this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by this disaster. I'd like to cover a few things this morning. A quick recap of the fourth quarter, a look back at last year and some thoughts and priorities for this new year. First, the fourth quarter. Jim will provide you with a detailed overview of the quarter, but I'd like to highlight a few things. Gross margin improvements continued, a true reflection of the increased profit levers we have developed and highlighted via Domestic segment. Adjusted margins that were up 90 basis points. We demonstrated expense control in the quarter. Total company SG&A was up only slightly, as we reduced spending in response to the sluggish sales environment. Now, looking back on the full year, we faced a restrained consumer in a difficult industry environment during the year, especially in televisions. The TV market was down significantly last year, caused in large part by demand for IPTV and 3D TV that did not materialize as the industry had anticipated. But despite these challenges, I'm pleased with how we responded and executed. We wanted to improve our gross margins last year, and we did. Despite lower comps, our Domestic business adjusted gross margin was up 90 basis points. Overall gross profit dollars were up and importantly, gross profit per square foot was up. Our cost control was good throughout the year. SG&A was up less than 5% for the year, which was an improvement from the previous year. Our adjusted operating income dollars were up and operating margin was up despite a down comp in a difficult industry environment for the year. I think this was a significant accomplishment. Putting it all together, despite the industry backdrop, the team responded well and our execution at the store level was good. Our retail customer satisfaction scores were up last year. Our close rate improved on a year-on-year basis and we had notable improvements in connections, accessories and Geek Squad Black Tie Protection. Having said that, we're never 100% satisfied with our customer experience and we intend to make it even better. More on that later. One of the strengths of Best Buy is our ability to change and adapt. One of our four company values, in fact, is to learn from challenge and change. The nature of our business requires us to constantly innovate. Just look at how quickly our assortment changes with the natural cycles of technology. Last year was no exception, and we took action to improve our model. We have made good progress on our Connected World strategy and in building out differentiated value propositions to thrive in that world. Best Buy Mobile is the tip of the spear in our connected world strategy, and we gained share in the mobile phone category overall in the U.S., and particularly in the smartphone category. Best Buy Mobile also saw improvements in both Geek Squad Black Tie Protection and accessories over last year. Special appreciation goes out to more than 20,000 Geek Squad agents, who enabled the highest and best possible customer service in-store or at home. Outside of mobile phones, we continued to see significant growth of connectivity in other areas. A good proof point of this was unit growth over 50% on AirCards and MiFi devices that deliver mobile broadband service to computing devices. As we've talked about, last summer we made significant changes to the store in a continuing effort to maximize our return on space. We decreased the size of declining categories and increased space of higher margin and faster growing categories. CD space was reduced by over 50%, and that space was allocated to fast-growing areas like Best Buy Mobile, eReaders and seasonal impulse products. In the fall, we launched the refresh of our Gaming business. Customers can now buy and sell pre-owned games in approximately 90% of our stores, and we've also added pre-ordered kiosks for new titles in all of our stores. The Gaming business has a long heritage at Best Buy, and we're determined to strengthen our position as a premier destination for all types of gamers. We also launched the Buy Back Program with a campaign that included our first ever Super Bowl commercial. Our research shows that a high percentage of consumers agree that concerns about obsolescence have likely prevented them, or would prevent them in the future from purchasing CE products. The Buy Back Program allows customers to future-proof their technology purchases in a world where technological advances are rapid and relentless. It's still early, but we've seen encouraging trends for this program to date. Outside of the period, it was offered for free. This program is particularly appealing in mobile phone and tablet categories, which gives us meaningful differentiation in two of the highest-growing categories in CE. As I mentioned, we recently announced a significant restructuring of our International business that we believe will build on the positive aspects of our International business performance last year. We had good sales growth led by Five Star in China and saw encouraging signs from smaller business like Mexico. Excluding the announced restructuring charges, our international operating income growth was up over 30% last year. Looking forward to fiscal 2012, Jim will take you through the guidance in detail, but here are some areas of particular focus. I strongly believe Best Buy's business model is positioned for success this year. We're fully aware that consumers are still relatively constrained and some of our major categories are coming off challenging years. As you saw from our sales guidance for this year, we're still assuming that some of these headwinds will continue. This is particularly a concern with a housing market that's still not growing, and the cost of energy will have a predictable impact to consumers. That said, we see several significant incremental opportunities this year, and we have targeted plans in place to take full advantage of them. One clear incremental opportunity for us this year is growing in product categories where we have lower share like mobile, appliances and gaming. And Mike Vitelli will take you through that detail in a moment. We also see an opportunity to enhance the overall returns of our stores and we are taking actions to realize that. First, we have projects that we expect will improve performance in our big-box stores, including key lessons from our connected store pilot and actions we're taking in our Appliance business; second, we've slowed big-box square footage growth; and third, we're increasing our points of presence in small-box formats like Best Buy Mobile, a model that's relevant to a new set of customers and one that has powerful and proven returns. To sum it up, we are exploring and redefining what the optimal big-box footprint is for us, and we're finding ways to maximize returns through a variety of actions, including extending many of our key categories that should increase customer footsteps every day. We believe a strong physical presence and a strong online presence is a major competitive advantage for Best Buy and a point of differentiation. Last year, our U.S. Dotcom business sales were up significantly and according to our estimates, our market share was also up in this channel. However, we have real opportunities to improve our performance in the online channel, and we're taking actions now to do this. We're responding to how customers want to shop. And what we're hearing loud and clear is that many customers want to use multiple channels. We offer customers options and solutions across all channels and across the entire spectrum of price points. As a testament to this, when you look across our U.S. big-box stores, and our Dotcom channel, our traffic was up in fiscal 2011. Last year, we deployed two new multi-channel options for customers to add to our already popular in-store pickup-within-the-hour approach. We started ship-to-store and friends and family guest pickup. After these two additions were deployed, we saw total in-store pickup go from approximately 35% to over 40% of all products sold online. And our Mobile Web and Apps business had the highest growth rate this year of any of our touch points, demonstrating that we are increasingly serving customers where and how they want to shop. An important proof point to support the value of multi-channel is the fact that recently, almost 80% of larger-screen TVs that were purchased online at Best Buy were picked up in the store. We believe we are an industry leader in giving consumers plenty of information, choice and speed in how they want to purchase their products. So what do we anticipate for TVs overall this year? We expect to see very large screen TVs, which will include all the latest technology at great prices. We will have to see how consumers respond to this environment, but we believe that this combination will play to our strengths because our strength is helping customers understand the new technology, walking them through the different options and having the Geek Squad deliver, install and set up the equipment. One last opportunity I'd like to briefly discuss is our International business. We've focused that business. We're investing strongly in the growth of Five Star, we continue to expand and drive our powerful warehouse [ph] Small-Box business and we're conservatively expanding our Best Buy stores in the relatively new markets of Mexico and the United Kingdom. I believe this focused strategy will allow our International business to contribute significantly to our overall profitability over time. Last month we announced some high profile changes to our business that demonstrate our commitment to focus investment only on efforts that meet our expectations for profitable returns. We will continue to be disciplined and tenacious about investing in areas that meet our standards for ROIC, and we intend to actively reach out to new customers of all ages and interests to take advantage of how easy it is to shop for, compare and buy with confidence at Best Buy in-store and online. To gain traction in this environment, we have to provide good reasons to shop and buy now. Our partnerships with the industry's largest investment manufacturers allow us the opportunity to attract and acquire increased numbers of new customers with strong offers, available credit and broad assortments of products, all backed with the industry's best technical service. This promise continues to be the foundation of our company and will serve our new and loyal customers. In closing, I am looking forward to this year. We have several exciting incremental opportunities in front of us that I believe play into Best Buy's core strengths, all the while being realistic about the headwinds we all see. We will continue to make the changes we need to make, to meet the challenges of this dynamic marketplace, to evolve our business and to focus our capital initiatives in the areas that generate the greatest customer acquisition and returns on our market-leading position. With that, I'd like to pass it to Mike Vitelli for some additional color around opportunities in our U.S. business. Mike?\\nMichael Vitelli: Thanks, Brian. One clear incremental opportunity for us is to grow in specific areas of our business. There are several areas in our store where we believe we have a powerful value proposition, with a great brand fit but our share is low. And we believe with effective communication and great execution, we have the opportunity to pick up additional share. First, mobile. Best Buy Mobile has been executing very well and we've gained share. But despite that strong showing, our share is still only around 6%. We're seeing solid momentum in this business. We're growing the footprint of mobile in our big-box stores to add additional accessories. And as we announced last month, we're planning to open an additional 150 mobile standalone stores, taking the count to a total of approximately 325 stores by the end of this year. In addition, our new Buy Back Program is especially relevant to mobile phone consumers, and we're seeing strong attach rates as well as increasing buyback attach rates when bundled with Geek Squad Black Tie Protection. Our biggest obstacle to growing mobile share appears to be awareness, and we believe the store count growth, supported by advertising to drive consumer awareness and smart promotions like Free Phone Fridays will address the awareness gap and accelerate our growth. Last year's hot product was the iPad, and we had success with the iPad and now again with the iPad 2. As choice becomes more important in the emerging tablet category, we are best positioned to showcase the choices and inspire our customers to the art of what's possible. We offer the ability to touch and try all the models side-by-side. We have employees who can explain the differences between the different products and platforms, offering unbiased advice. Best Buy customers can maximize the benefits of their purchases with the accessories, content and connections that they want and need. To make this experience come to life, we intend to use a similar proven labor, training and compensation operating model used by Best Buy Mobile to drive the Tablet business. Finally, we've launched our Buy Back Program for tablets, which, like mobile phones, is particularly relevant for consumers who love to have the latest and greatest. And Buy Back makes Best Buy a great place to buy your smartphone and your tablet. Another opportunity is appliances. Appliances represented 5% of our U.S. sales last year and we're still number four in the market. But appliances has a big footprint in our stores, and we need to get a better return on that space. We believe we can make significant improvements to our Appliance business and improve our share position. We're seeing it already. As a good example, we’ve seen solid results when we take key elements of the Pacific Sales appliance model into Best Buy. Currently, we have eight Pac sales stored [ph] in the store concepts on the West Coast. And in Southern California where we have both Best Buy and Pac sales, we've seen both higher market share and better growth for our appliance business overall. The gaming industry is a $20 billion business in which Best Buy is number two in hardware and number three in software, and we currently have a very small share in preowned games. In order to improve our position and materially change the way we compete in this space, we're making investments in dedicated gaming labor, in-store and online pre-order and trade-in capability and digital content. First we've added the ability to pre-order games in all of our stores and on BestBuy.com. We'll also change our promotional rhythm on new games to promote them during the pre-release and pre-order periods, when most consumer activity occurs for many iconic franchise games. Second, we've added the ability to trade-in used games at Best Buy for the more attractive Best Buy Gift Card, and this includes the ability to use those trade-in dollars for anything in the Best Buy store, not just game titles. Best Buy will offer an outstanding gaming experience for our customers, and these investments will allow us to participate in the multibillion-dollar digital and preowned spaces that are almost entirely incremental to our current business with higher margins, and we regularly expect this to drive traffic to our stores. We're seeing very good signs that customers are eager for choices and like our offers. And before now that I hand this over to Jim, I'd like to discuss one more thing. There’s been some discussion recently about our pricing strategy that is incorrect and I'd like to take this opportunity to address this. Can we do things to improve our price impressions with customers? Absolutely. We see this opportunity and we're acting on it. And we also know we bring value to buying technology in more ways than just price. As a result, we believe and our share would support, that we're perhaps the leading destination to buy technology in the world. First and foremost, we’re committed in our stores and online, to ensure people buy the right technology to meet their needs and the accessories, connections, content and services to get them the experience that made them want to buy it in the first place. What's more, we make technology more accessible through financing and Reward Zone. We make it easy to get their technology up and stay running through a wide array of service products, and we allow consumers to future-proof and protect their technology through products like Buy Back and Geek Squad Black-tie Protection. Pricing transparency has never been better for our customers. It's easy to price check products today, even right in your hand on your smartphone. But many of our value-added promotions like financing and Reward Zone, and others like bundled savings don't translate well into SKU-only product price comparison engines. Best Buy intends to use a variety of pricing strategies to compete against a diverse set of competitors which often differ by category. We sell thousands of products and services in dozens of different categories. Applying a single pricing strategy across all of our products and categories would not be practical or rewarding. My point is that price matters and so does value, and we want to make sure that we're more effectively communicating our prices and value offers in all Best Buy channels everyday to get customers the best and right solutions for each of them. With that, I'll hand it over to Jim.\\nJames Muehlbauer: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start this morning by recapping our fourth quarter financial results, and by providing some additional color on our performance. Then I'll recap what we set out to accomplish in fiscal '11 and how we performed against those goals. We will close with our thoughts on how we currently see fiscal '12 playing out and the resulting financial guidance. As Bill noted up front, the numbers we will be discussing exclude the restructuring charges detailed in our release this morning. This morning, we announced adjusted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.98, which was up 9% versus last year. As Brian mentioned up front, we are pleased to continue the theme of strong gross margin performance, driven primarily by strength in our key connectivity category, Best Buy Mobile, along with disciplined SG&A spending set against the consumer demand backdrop in our industry. Let's quickly run through some of the key headlines. First, in the fourth quarter, revenue declined 2%, driven by a comparable store sales decline of 4.6% and partially offset by new store growth. In our Domestic segment, fourth quarter revenues decreased almost 4% from last year to $12.1 billion, as comparable store sales declined 5.5%. While on the surface, this decline appears similar to what we experienced in the third quarter, the trend was actually modestly better when you look at the two-year comp and consider that domestic comparable store sales were up over 7% in the fourth quarter last year. The decline in comp store sales was driven primarily by a couple of factors. First, the industry continued to experience lower demand in key categories, including TVs and notebook computers. Second, we were up against a nearly 40% comparable store sales gain last year in mobile computing, largely due to the launch of Windows 7. Sales in our International segment increased approximately 4% to $4.1 billion, driven primarily by new store growth and the impact of favorable FX rates. These gains were partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 1.3%. Our Best Buy Europe business experienced a low single-digit percent increase in comparable store sales for the quarter. Canada saw many of the same consumer demand industry headwinds that were experienced in the Domestic segment, which resulted in a similar low single-digit comparable store sales decline. In Five Star, we experienced a low single-digit comparable store sales decline as we began to lapse [ph] significant year-over-year strength. For context, our Five Star comparable store sales growth was over 35% during the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. For the full year, Five Star experienced a comparable store sales growth of 18% in fiscal '11. Turning now to gross margins, the highlight for the quarter was again the continued expansion of our gross profit rate. Total company gross profit rate of 24.4% reflected a 40-basis-point year-over-year improvement. The domestic gross profit rate was up 90 basis points to 24.5%. The 90-basis-point expansion can be attributed to overall flat rates and an improvement in mix due to continued growth in Best Buy Mobile and a lower mix of computing and entertainment hardware and software. Additionally, similar to the first three quarters of the year, gross margin rates improved slightly as a larger portion of our vendor programs were orientated towards purchase incentives instead of advertising support, which is recorded as a reduction in SG&A. Just as a reminder, this is the last quarter this reclassification will impact our year-over-year financial comparisons as we will anniversary this change in the first quarter of fiscal '12. Within the International segment, the gross profit rate of 24.2% reflects a 120-basis-point decline year-over-year, primarily driven by a higher mix of sales in the B2B channel in Europe, partially offset by strong margin improvements by both our Five Star and our teams in Canada. Turning to SG&A, fourth quarter expenses increased just 2% year-over-year to $2.7 billion. SG&A dollar growth was limited due to tight cost controls on variable spending items. In addition, similar to the third quarter, SG&A also benefited from lower incentive compensation expense tied to our overall financial results. Lower incentive costs favorably impacted our overall rate by 40 and 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the full year respectively. Bringing it all together, the net result is that the fourth quarter operating income decreased 4% versus last year to $1.2 billion or 7.5% of sales. Again, these results exclude the restructuring costs Bill referenced. I also wanted to touch on a couple of specific points related to how we closed out the year to help avoid any potential confusion. First, the year ended with higher-than-usual working capital, including inventory, accounts payable and accounts receivable. Each of these items included several timing-related events, so let's spend a minute and touch on each of the key drivers. As you saw in the release, total inventory was up 7.5% year-over-year compared to up 12% at the end of the third quarter. In Q4, growth from new stores and changes in foreign currency contributed approximately half of the inventory increase. Domestic comparable store inventory in Q4 was up 2% and reflected an improvement over the third quarter, which was up 8%. The growth in domestic inventory was principally in support of the continued strong sales growth in Best Buy Mobile. As the company reduced inventory receipts in January and February in response to holiday sales trends, total accounts payable declined as we paid for our existing inventory under our normal practices. Accordingly, accounts payable finished the year lower than last year due to timing changes in our inventory receipt patterns this year. And finally, we also saw an increase in the receivables at year-end, due to the timing of several large payments due from our vendors. A large portion of these payments have been received since our year-end. The combined impact of the above items increased our year-end working capital and lowered free cash flow. To be clear, our overall working capital and cash flow model has not changed significantly, as these items are timing in nature. We anticipate our working capital positions will return to more normalized levels in the first half of fiscal '12, which will benefit our year-over-year free cash flow generation. Second, our effective tax rate of 31.4% was lower than last year and our expectations, due primarily to the favorable resolution of several tax matters in the quarter and a higher proportion of our income from foreign operations, which is taxed at lower rates. We estimate that temporary reductions in our tax rate favorably impacted the fourth quarter and full year earnings by approximately $0.12 and $0.11 respectively. While there were certainly challenges that both Best Buy and the CE industry faced in fiscal '11, we also saw exciting growth opportunities in new connected technologies and achieved several important goals that we set out to accomplish during the year. We drove profitable sales growth in key parts of our business such as Best Buy Mobile by opening up over 100 new stand-alone stores, and saw continued growth in our profitable Five Star model in China. Domestic gross profit margins grew by 90 basis points for the year. This year-over-year gain shows that our connectivity strategy is gaining traction and demonstrates our ability to respond to market opportunities and grow margins even when some product categories are challenged, which we believe positions us well for the future. We announced restructuring plans for our International business, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing our profitability and returns. We exercised strong cost discipline in a tough environment, which limited SG&A dollar growth to 4.6% for the year. Setting aside the impact of the restructuring, this cost control, combined with our significant gross margin expansion, allowed us to grow operating income dollars 2% and operating income rate 10 basis points for the full year, despite a negative comp sales environment. And lastly, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion or 33 million shares of our stock, which is over 8% of the previously outstanding shares of the company during fiscal '11. This was the second largest year of repurchase activity in the history of the company, and we continue to see share repurchases as one of the important elements of improving returns for our shareholders over time. Looking ahead to fiscal '12, we recognize that there continues to be many variables in the environment. It appears likely that macro influences such as unemployment, housing and higher gas prices may continue to pressure consumers. Strong companies and brands like Best Buy utilize times like these to play offense and leverage their position in the marketplace. We plan to pursue profitable growth opportunities by focusing on key connectivity categories like Best Buy Mobile, and exciting new technologies like tablets. As Mike discussed earlier, we are also planning to grow our Gaming and Appliance businesses in the year. Given these competing factors, our fiscal '12 plans reflect a range of potential outcomes, and are focused on making prudent investments in several profitable growth areas of our business, while maintaining disciplined cost control. Our fiscal 2012 guidance calls for top line revenue of $51 billion to $52.5 billion, which is an average of 1% to 4% growth year-over-year. Key assumptions behind this outlook include the new store plans we disclosed in late February, which call for approximately 150 new Best Buy Mobile standalone stores, U.S. big-box square footage growth of less than 1% and 40 to 50 new Five Star stores in China. Additionally, we anticipate that the inclusion of the 53rd week during the fiscal fourth quarter will add approximately 1.5% to 2% year-over-year to our top line revenue. Partially offsetting these gains is our comparable store sales estimate for the year of flat to down 3%, which reflects our current view of the range of potential outcomes in this environment. Looking at gross margins, we expect to grow gross margins next year but at a more modest rate than in fiscal '11. We anticipate a large portion of this growth will be driven by further progress in our connectable categories led by Best Buy Mobile. As I mentioned earlier, we made solid progress in focusing our discretionary SG&A spending in fiscal '11. We will be prudent in our SG&A investments, striking an important balance of pushing forward on profitable growth areas and managing our SG&A. Given planned investments to grow our Connections business, the addition of the 53rd week and the impact of lapping more incentive costs in fiscal '11, we anticipate that total SG&A dollar spending will grow approximately 4% for the year or approximately 2%, excluding the impact of higher incentive comp and the 53rd week. So rolling it all up, we anticipate that total operating income dollars will be flat to up 7%, as improvements in our gross margin rate mitigate potential softness in the comp sales environment. We also anticipate that the recently completed bond offering will add approximately $50 million to our full year net interest expense. Doing the math, this translates to approximately $0.08 of EPS for the year. Bringing it all together, we are forecasting annual non-GAAP EPS of $3.30 to $3.55 for fiscal 2012, which represents a 4% decrease to 4% increase year-over-year, excluding restructuring related charges. This adjusted EPS guidance also excludes the impact of any potential share repurchases in fiscal 2012. Taking a quick look at our fiscal '12 CapEx outlook, we expect to spend approximately $800 million, which would be slightly lower than our fiscal 2011 CapEx spend. With that as context for what we expect for the full year, let's shift gears and spend a minute on our phasing expectations for fiscal '12. First, we expect that our comparable store sales performance in the first half, especially in the first quarter, will be similar to the quarter we've just completed. Additionally, we anticipate that the second half sales will improve over the first half trends based on the actions already discussed by Brian and Mike earlier, including the initiatives in our Best Buy Mobile, Tablets, Gaming and Appliance businesses. And of course, we'll be up against much easier compares in the second half of the year. Regarding SG&A for the year, we anticipate higher growth in the second half of the year as incentive compensation returns to more normalized levels, and given the inclusion of the 53rd week in the fourth quarter. Given the phasing of our fiscal '11 actual results and the above assumptions, we do not anticipate that year-over-year EPS growth will grow until the second half of fiscal 2012. One last thought on our outlook. Currently, we are not aware of any significant impacts to our business as a result of the recent tragedy in Japan. We are in contact with our vendor partners and suppliers but recognize that it is still too early for them to assess what impact, if any, this may have on our business in fiscal '12. In closing, there were challenging elements that impacted the CE industry and Best Buy during fiscal '11. Consumers are clearly telling us that they are interested in capturing all the benefits of a connected lifestyle, but they are also selective about how and where they spend their discretionary dollars. We believe the strength of our multi-channel approach in serving customers; the ability to showcase all the latest and greatest technologies all in one place, coupled with our knowledgeable Blue Shirts who can help customers get the most out of their spending; continues to position our model attractively for customers, vendors and shareholders. Equally, we realize that we have many opportunities to improve our model, attract new customers and drive stronger performance in the near term and beyond. So with that, Alicia, we are ready for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  And our first question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.\\nDaniel Binder: You spoke a little bit about pricing and what you'd like to accomplish over the next year. I was wondering if you can give us maybe a little bit more of an example of how you create -- in a world of higher pricing transparency, how you create a better price image, when in fact, someone is doing a search, whether it's on a smartphone or other device on SKU-specific pricing?\\nMichael Vitelli: This is Mike Vitelli. It's a great question. And I would say the biggest singular thing that we're doing right now and we began it in the second half of this year is dramatically expanding our Online Only assortment. These are the people that we're competing with that have very, very broad assortments. And what we're doing, rather than just figuring out how to expand the assortment in the store, is dramatically increasing the assortment online. For example, historically we would carry 100 televisions, I'm using that as an illustration, 100 televisions within the store. Now we'll have over 400 televisions online, of which 300 will be Online Only. And that allows us to be very aggressive in the Online Only pricing, because we have a similar operating model there to compete effectively in that channel.\\nDaniel Binder: If I'm allowed a follow-on to that, how will you support that? How will you support the inventory needs? Is that through some sort of a wholesaler or is that just keeping limited inventory in the central warehouse?\\nMichael Vitelli: There's a variety of ways. Some of the SKUs we would own and we'd keep in the centralized warehouse. Others could be done through supplier direct for some that are handled either by the supplier themselves or distribution. So there's a variety of ways to do it. But to your point, it's a much lower inventory position. So a much higher return on inventory that way.\\nBrian Dunn: This is Brian. The strategy mike just outlined, we believe allows us to be sharper on our online pricing and create the accurate price image of the sort of value Best Buy presents each and every day to our customers.\\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Strasser with Janney Montgomoery Scott.\\nDavid Strasser: I guess a question regarding CapEx. You talked about $800 million, can you kind of break that down? I know you tend to do it in the K, but can you break it down a little bit more detail, as far as new stores versus IT spending and sort of where the biggest buckets are and what you’re going to try and get out of it?\\nBrian Dunn: I'm going to turn it over to Jim in just a second, this is Brian. The frame we’ve used in or CapEx allocations this year, in the places where we have matured businesses where we are invested like our Big-Box business, our intention is to leverage those investments. It's also clearly our intent to deploy our capital and our human resource against growth areas, some of which you heard about this morning. I think maybe, Jim, you can give a little color on what some of those growth areas are.\\nJames Muehlbauer: As you would expect, as we have been lowering the number of big-box new stores over the last three or four years, our CapEx spending dedicated to U.S. big-box growth has been coming down significantly. We've also been using money over the last couple of years to remodel our existing stores and put value props in place where we know that there's high levels of consumer demand in spaces where our share is like Best Buy Mobile. So what you see happening next year is, while the capital is actually coming down a little bit year-over-year, there is a shift in capital spending that's really been a continuation of a theme in that we continue to lower our big-box capital spending, but we're ramping up our capital spend on profitable new models like Best Buy Mobile, and we're ramping up spending next year to support the profitable growth we see in China around our Five Star business as well.\\nBrian Dunn: And as I said in my remarks, these are proven profitable models that we're quite happy to invest in.\\nJames Muehlbauer: Other areas of investment really dovetail the parts of the business that Mike and Brian talked about earlier in looking at opportunities to improve our store environment around our Gaming business to support pre-orders and used game, and really doing something more than just a physical presence, but actually building a labor model to support customers in the gaming space, to give them the advise and service that we think could be a large differentiator in improving our sales and share in that space.\\nBrian Dunn: You'll also see us investing in our Dotcom capabilities which we're very enthusiastic about.\\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Schick with Stifel, Nicolaus.\\nDavid Schick: So, the Buy Back Program. You mentioned the attach rates are strong and I guess, how should we think about the impact on 2011 and really beyond on the margin structure of Best Buy?\\nBrian Dunn: I'll ask Jim to comment on the financials. I will tell you the math is early. As I mentioned on the call, we're very pleased with what we've seen so far. We love what this does for customers, and the early results indicate customers appreciate it. As I mentioned, particularly in smartphones and the emerging tablet category, very, very high acceptance. And Jim, do you want to comment or not comment on the financials?\\nJames Muehlbauer: Yes, happy to. Clearly that program is meant to do a couple of things. First and foremost, as Mike Vitelli talked about, we're using that as an opportunity to demonstrate what we can do differently for customers to increase their comforts in buying [ph] purchases. So that, for us, is really about the traffic in a closed vehicle. The economics of that, over time, will depend upon how customers actually behave and what those products actually do from a resale standpoint. But key thing for us is, we're using that as a differentiator to drive traffic, close sales. And then just as a reminder, in that program we've actually ceded the kind of residual value of the exposure of those purchases will be with a third-party. So once Best Buy initiates the fund into that transaction, we have no longer -- we don't have to continuing liability as it relates to the product.\\nBrian Dunn: It really is -- the Buy Back Program, I think, stands as an excellent opportunity to highlight what will be the constant innovation that goes on within our model. We take what we learn from our customers and what we know what's happening in the industry and increasingly, customers are becoming accustomed to this notion of XYZ one this year. I’ve got two next year and on and on and on, and that rhythm has created great excitement for customers, also some anxiety about buying. And I think that Buy Back is just a great example of the continuing innovation around our model.\\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\\nScot Ciccarelli: You guys have obviously closed your stores in Turkey, you’ve closed the Best Buy stores in China and new store growth in the U.S. is now just over flat. Are we at the point where we may start to see your existing U.S. big-box store portfolio start to undergo some more meaningful changes?\\nBrian Dunn: We are constantly assessing all parts of our business. We're looking to improve returns wherever we can. I think what's really important about our strategy is we are looking to increase distribution points and customer touch points. One of the things we like so well about the Best Buy Mobile model and why we're accelerating our growth there, because it gives us additional touch points while we're accessing new customers. And you're going to continue to see Shari and our real estate team work diligently to increase the touch points and to be as efficient as possible with our space deployment.\\nShari Ballard: Scott, this is Shari. A couple of things in the near-term, we think our opportunities in the big-box stores to get better returns, one is around the operating model. Mike mentioned this in his remarks. But in categories like tablets, in mobile, in appliances where we see an enormous amount of customer need that we think is still, and is very unfulfilled. We'll use different operating models in those spaces to get the right amount of labor in with the customer, in a way that we think we can get better returns. So in those particular categories, those are queued up this year for that. And then two, I would call the general bucket of space, better returns in the existing stores from a category perspective. So we've expanded the space around Best Buy Mobile, we'll expand around tablets, and as we mentioned, we'll expand around gaming and the used gaming and gaming trade-in. More broadly on real estate, yes, we've got opportunity in the big-box portfolio. We're still a little bit early, but we like what we're seeing in the connected stores right now in terms of our ability to handle the traffic, to show customers better Connected World and multichannel value propositions in a less space. So there is definitely opportunity from the size of the typical big-box stores.\\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Peter Keith with JMP Securities.\\nPeter Keith: I know you'd highlighted in your press release that the Q4 market share had improved relative to 3Q, which I guess would be in line with your historical trends. Just curious if you could just provide how you thought the year-over-year change in market share trended relative to the 125-basis-point change in 3Q. And then related to that, I know you've got a number of drivers with some of your emerging categories to drive share, I guess what type of market share gain or loss is currently embedded in your sales guidance?\\nMichael Vitelli: The first part of your question, as you mentioned, our market share was sequentially improved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. The declines we saw are consistent with what we saw in the third quarter. But for the year, in looking at it for the total of the year, last year our share was approximately 22%, again in the categories that we're measuring here, which it’s important to call out our [ph] missing the things that were growing the fastest in cellphones, services, tablets. These aren't in these track numbers yet. But our share this year was down about 100 basis points for the year. We were up 170 last year, so we're still on a sequencing trend positive over a multiyear basis. We have a very strong number one position in television, computing and digital imaging and television. Our share is higher than the next three competitors combined. So in those areas, we're going to really vigorously defend the share in those three positions. The biggest thing we're going to do to grow share is what I mentioned earlier, we have four categories for our shares that are in single digits. Gaming and software, we have probably a little over that, but we have massive area for improvement in mobile, appliances, tablets is just beginning. So these are all areas of -- that's where we see the growth coming from while we maintain and continue to grow a bit the really strong sales positions and share positions we have in the big three.\\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ian (sic) [Daniel] Wewer with Raymond James.\\nDaniel Wewer: It's Dan. So we talked about growing market share in categories where your share is low. I wanted to talk about the other scenario, categories where you're benefiting from a large market share but sales are struggling. And I guess the one category that really stands out is televisions. You noted that the new technology is not resonating with your customers, there may be some competitive issues, perhaps penetration rates of high-def TVs are already so high, there's not a lot left in a way of growth. But I'd be very curious to see what the game plan is for stimulating TV sales in FY '12, or perhaps are we just pushing on a string and that's the reason why the other comp sales outlook is flat or minus 3% for this new year.\\nMichael Vitelli: If you're talking about TV specifically for a moment, the second half of last year was a different cost [ph] environment for the industry. Industry projections, therefore were relatively modest this year on an industry basis. One of the things we're doing in planning to grow our share in television is twofold. One is the industry is going to be focused on larger screen sizes, and we think that fits very well within our model, as Brian mentioned earlier, about large televisions being ordered online or in the store but being picked up in the store, because that's what people want to do with those televisions of that size versus shipping it. But equally important is what I mentioned earlier, is the rapid expansion of our Online Only assortment. That's going to allow us -- because we weren’t competing in those SKUs in prior periods.\\nDaniel Wewer: But aren't you carrying the most relevant SKUs in your store? And therefore that strategy may not be as effective?\\nBrian Dunn: Well, I think you're going to get both. We are in fact carrying the most relevant SKUs in the store but there are still -- we were, in a sense, calling down a 500-SKU assortment to put 100 SKUs in the store. Yes, they're the most relevant. The other 400 are selling. We just weren’t selling them, and now we're going to be able to aggressively do that.\\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\\nBrian Nagel: I wanted to ask a question just on domestic gross margins. So we've seen, for a few quarters now, some very nice expansion. And given the sales data you give us, it's clear that sales is a mix shift to higher margin categories in mobile, et cetera. As you look at the specific categories, in the margins within those categories -- the question I have, is the better domestic gross margin we've seen primarily a result of the sales shift or are there actually fluctuating margins within the categories in the stores?\\nBrian Dunn: I'll start with an overview and then Jim or Mike can jump in. Brian, clearly, Best Buy Mobile carried a huge piece of that rate improvement for us in Q4. The shift, the mix shift was very large for us, a big piece of that. And I'll leave it to Mike to comment within categories. You see any notable trends there?\\nJames Muehlbauer: Yes, Brian, I'm going to take that. So certainly, as we look at the different parts of our business, you have pieces moving in different directions but from a macro standpoint, as we noted in our release, basically the improvement in gross profit through most of the year has been mix-driven based on what happened in Best Buy Mobile growing successfully, and just a lower portion of notebook computers in our mix. I'll remind you that, remember last year in Q4, with the launch of Windows 7, notebooks in the mix went way up. So it depressed our margins in Q4 of last year, once again that was mix-driven. Overall, our rates in most of our categories has stayed very fairly stable. One exception would be in the Television business, and that's purely due to the mix of the type of TV sales that we've seen this year versus the previous year. As Mike mentioned, the new technologies that the industry planned to sell this year didn't grow as fast as the industry planned. We sold more mid-line televisions and lower-end televisions, so our margins in that space came down. But I would attribute that to kind of mix within the TV category, not a rate on a SKU-per-SKU-type product. So overall, rates relatively stable through the year. We think we have opportunities to drive more sales going forward as Mike talked about. That's going to have some impact and pressure on the rates next year, but those are incremental sales dollars and incremental margin dollars, that's why the guidance we've provided next year is expecting gross margins to grow, albeit at a slower rate than we saw this year.\\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.\\nMatthew Fassler: My question relates to home office, and I want to address what looks to be the pretty sharp deceleration in home office and mobile computing in the latter two months of the quarter. And then relate that if you could to your broad expectations as to how tablets roll into the mix in calendar '11 and impact that Home Office business as we move through the year.\\nJames Muehlbauer: This is Jim, why don't I take kind of the front half of that and Mike will talk a little bit about what we're seeing in tablets and what we see into next year. Just maybe take a second to remind everybody that what's going on in part in the computing space, which is in home office last year, is we had the launch of Windows 7 last year. So late in Q3, early in Q4, our computing comps were way down as we were bleeding down inventories to prepare for that Windows 7 launch. Computing comps in January and February last year were enormous in the business. I know I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we saw Q4 comps in mobile computing of up 40%, driven by that. So part of what you're seeing in your comment is just what we're lapping last year from a computing experience standpoint. And I’ll let Mike talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the Tablet business and going forward.\\nMichael Vitelli: We're excited about the opportunity that tablets is presenting. I think from June on, there'll be a good range of competitors coming into market, and when choice then becomes more of a prevalent issue, our model can do well there. Our assortment breadth, both in the store and online, gives you an opportunity to touch and feel these products side-by-side. And as I mentioned earlier, customers can walk people through the different platforms, because that's becoming increasingly important of the ecosystem that the different tablet will have to live in, whether it's the Android platform, the IOS platform, the emerging webOS platform. That's going to be important for consumers to understand and see, and we think we’re going to be the best place to see all three of those live and in person.\\nMatthew Fassler: Just a little follow-up, Jim. You spoke about the compares last year. My numbers could be off, but it looks like the December home office comp number last year was sort of stronger than the fourth quarter overall. It looks like up 29 in December and up 22 for Q4 in terms of domestic comps. So is it just compares or anything else in the underlying trend or tablet cannibalization or people waiting for the iPad 2 or something like that, that might have impacted the underlying count?\\nJames Muehlbauer: Matt, I don't have the December mobile comps for last year sitting in front of me right now, but what I'm processing through, and we can follow up with you. Also in that number us Best Buy Mobile which would have had a significant comp last year during the holiday season as well.\\nOperator: And the last question is from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\\nChristopher Horvers: I was just curious, I wanted to follow up on the previous question on the U.S. big-box store base. It seems to me like as TVs mature, you’ll see some skew rationalization, mobile next accessory footprint is up dramatically in the past two years, and ultimately convergence knocks out some categories or the space needed in PC and GPS. I know you're investing in gaming, that seems also like an eventually declining category. So with 8% of your stores up for renewal each year, is there something else that's keeping you from closing stores in the U.S? Is it the age of the underperforming stores, maybe opening [indiscernible] (59:51) five, or do you expect innovation to ultimately be able to refill that space?\\nJames Muehlbauer: This is Jim. As we mentioned earlier, I think it's the combination of things. There's nothing that's preventing us from doing things that we see in the model today that we should be taking actions on. So to Shari's point, as we see opportunities in the marketplace to improve the utilization of our square footage, we’re actually doing it. I think for the things that we see in the models specifically for next year around investing in gaming and things of that nature, we’re not talking about enormous investments in those spaces to improve the productivity of those stores. Similar to what we think we can experience in the appliance space, given a better value proposition and labor model around selling appliances like we're seeing in our early days of our Pac sales stores within Best Buy stores, demonstrates that we've got the right traffic in the store to convert customers if we have a better value prop and labor model. That's really where we saw the success in Best Buy Mobile, putting Best Buy Mobile in the store. Initially we didn't bring new customers into the store, we were leveraging the traffic that's there, and that space is way more productive than it was before. So we think we have opportunities to both to do that, but to also Shari's point, we also think we have opportunities as we see how these labor models evolve to meet customer needs. We think we can pull that off in smaller square footage. And as we get sharper on what that looks like and how customers respond to that in this environment, we'll be pulling those leverage to accommodate that as well.\\nChristopher Horvers: So the message here is like you recognize that some of your stores are maybe too big and you're slowing down the growth, but where you're trying to figure out exactly what the right size of the store should be and that's the TBD that's basically holding that piece of the story?\\nShari Ballard: This is Shari. We're actually making some moves now in existing stores and making them smaller. So that's not holding us back. As renewals come up, we can and are making some of the larger stores smaller. We think the biggest and best near-term opportunity is in what I said earlier. If you look at a store-by-store basis, the biggest near-term opportunity is in lowering the square footage of existing locations. That doesn't mean we won't do things on a location-by-location basis that are different than that, but the largest opportunity is in better returns in existing locations using smaller square footage.\\nBrian Dunn: I think there's a couple other quick points, this is Brian, that I think are important if you're considering this. One, the notion that, for our categories that we sell and represent better than anyone in the world that have to be experienced. Home Theater is one of those, and we don't see anything coming down the road that's going to change the very personal nature of people picking out the home theater componentry that makes the most sense for them. That's just sort of one example. And the second thing I'd ask everyone to consider, I think there's changes on the horizon potentially around taxation. And as those things play out, it's going to change the role of physical distribution and how multi-channel, the online works and coexists with the physical. So we are very, very carefully looking at our square footage, but we're also very clear that there are things we do better that need to be done physically, and we do it better than anyone in the world. We appreciate the question. Thank you very much.\\nBill Seymour: Thank you, Alicia, and thanks to our audience for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC. At this time, Emerson's management will discuss non-GAAP measurements about the company's performance, and the reconciliation of those to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Contained within this presentation is posted on the Investor Relations of Emerson's website at www.emerson.com/financial. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Lynne Maxeiner. Please go ahead.\\nLynne Maxeiner: Thank you, Jeremy. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2010 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments, and is available in the Investor Relations section of Emerson's corporate website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Third quarter sales were up 11% to $5.6 billion with increases in all five segments, underlying sales growth of 7% with growth resuming in the U.S. and Europe. Operating profit margin improved 330 basis points to 18%, which is a modern-day record for Emerson. Business segment EBIT margin, up strongly increasing 460 basis points to 16.9%. Earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.78, up 53%. Operating cash flow of $703 million and free cash flow of $581 million. Our free cash flow conversion year-to-date is 122%. Strong trade working capital performance in the quarter with trade working capital as a percent of sales improving from 19.4% to 16.3%. We do believe the recovery will be gradual and reasonably steady, and we do not expect a double-dip recession. Next slide, the P&L. Sales in the quarter of $5.641 billion, again up 11%. Underlying sales increased 7%, acquisitions added three points and currency added one point. Operating profit of $1.017 billion or 18% of sales, the increase driven by cost reduction benefits and volume leverage. We are seeing our investments in new products and technologies paying off here, and we continue to increase investments in technology and growth. Earnings from continuing ops, up 53% to $594 million. Diluted average shares in the quarter of $757.7 million, which gets you to an EPS from continuing ops of $0.78, again up 53%. A negative $0.01 impact from disc ops [discontinued operations] related to LANDesk gets you to the reported EPS of $0.77. Slide 4, underlying sales by geography. Growth resumed in most regions, with the U.S. up 11% and Europe up 9%. Asia was up 3%, Latin America up 7%, Canada was flat and the Middle East/Africa, down 8%. Total international growth in the quarter of 4%, which gets you to the total underlying sales of 7%. Currency adds one point and acquisitions adds three points, which gets you to the 11% increase in consolidated sales. China was up 7% in the quarter and is still expected to be up 12% to 15% for fiscal 2010. Our trailing three-month underlying order trends excluding currency are up approximately 18%. Next slide, more income statement detail. Gross profit dollars of $2.211 billion or 39.2% of sales, an increase of 310 basis points. This was driven by aggressive cost containment programs, volume leverage, restructuring benefits, acquisitions and favorable mix including new products. SG&A was 21.2% of sales, getting you to operating profit dollars of $1.017 billion or 18% of sales. Other deductions net of $70 million, with restructuring expense $56 million lower and favorable currency impact partially offset by higher amortization expense. Interest expense of $64 million gets you to the pretax earnings of $883 million or 15.7% of sales. Taxes in the quarter of $273 million for a tax rate of 31%. The tax rate for the fiscal year is estimated at approximately 30%. Slide 6, the cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow of $703 million, down 23% versus an extremely strong Q3 2009, when we had operating working capital liquidation of over $400 million. Capital expenditures of $122 million gets you to the free cash flow of $581 million. Our free cash flow conversion in Q3 was 99%. The trade working capital balances show another quarter of very strong improvement in trade working capital as a percent of sales ratio, improving to 16.3% of sales on the quarter. Slide 7, the business segment P&L. Business segment EBIT in the quarter of $988 million or 16.9% of sales, up 53% or 460 basis points with benefits from cost reductions, volume leverage and lower restructuring costs. Difference of accounting methods was $52 million, corporate and other of $93 million, an increase of $16 million. We had lower one-time and commodity mark-to-market gains this quarter versus the prior year quarter. Stock compensation was neutral in the third quarter 2010, but will likely be a headwind next quarter in fourth quarter 2010. Earnings before interest and taxes from continuing ops of $947 million, interest expense again $64 million gets you to our pretax earnings of $883 million. Next, we'll go to the business segment starting with Process Management on Slide 8. Sales in the quarter of $1.511 billion, up 2%. Underlying sales were down 1%, acquisitions added two points and currency added one point. By region, the U.S. was up 12%; Asia, down 10%; Europe, down 2%; and Middle East/Africa, down 19%. Order rates are rebounding globally. The trailing three-month underlying orders excluding currency are up approximately 10%. MRO spending is driving the sales growth, and we have seen project quoting activity increasing. EBIT dollars of $311 million or 20.6% of sales, up 41% driven by significant cost containment actions, restructuring benefits, positive mix, lower restructuring expense and favorable impact from foreign currency transactions. We continue to increase our investments in technology and recently opened a $30 million global innovation center including the world's largest flow lab. Next slide, Industrial Automation. Sales in the quarter of $956 million, up 18%. Underlying sales were up 16%, and acquisitions added two points. By geography, the U.S. was up 12%; Europe was up 20%; and Asia was up 10%. We saw broad-based growth across businesses and geographies within Industrial Automation. Trailing three-month underlying orders excluding currency are up approximately 45%, and we see our global power generation orders coming back very strongly. EBIT dollars of $122 million or 12.8% of sales, driven by volume leverage and cost reduction benefits. During the quarter, we acquired Nutsteel in Brazil. This acquisition expands our presence in the global power distribution market. Slide 10, Network Power. Sales in the quarter of $1.418 billion, an increase of 7%. Underlying sales were down 1%. The Avocent acquisition added seven points, and currency added one point. By geography, the U.S. was up 5%, Asia was down 3% on a tough prior year comparison, and Europe was flat. The trailing three-month underlying order trends excluding currency are up approximately 12%. EBIT dollars of $182 million or 12.8% of sales, up 31% with positive impact from significant cost reduction benefits, lower restructuring expense and favorable foreign currency transaction impact. In the quarter, Emerson announced the terms of an all-cash offer for Chloride Group PLC. The shareholder vote is scheduled for August 9. Next slide, Climate Technologies. Sales in the quarter of $1.106 billion, up 29%. Underlying sales, up 28% and acquisitions added one point. By region, U.S. was up 23%, Europe was up 22% and Asia was up 49%. We saw broad-based strength across Asian end markets, as well as strength in European refrigeration and U.S. residential, refrigeration and commercial end markets. There is also solid growth in global transport end markets. Trailing three-month underlying order trends excluding currency remain strong around 20% but are moderating from the peak levels as comparisons get tougher. EBIT dollars of $221 million or 20.1% of sales, the margin improvement driven by volume leverage, benefits from cost containment actions and lower restructuring expense. Materials cost containment was substantially offset by price and wage inflation. Slide 12, Appliance and Tools. Sales up 10% to $850 million. Underlying sales increased 8% and acquisitions added two points. By geography, the U.S. was up 8%, Europe was up 23% and Asia declined 2%. We saw growth in the Tools, Motors and Appliance Solutions businesses, though it's partially offset by a decline in the Residential Storage business. Trailing three-month underlying orders excluding currency were up approximately 7%. EBIT dollars of $152 million or 18% of sales driven by volume leverage, restructuring benefits and cost containment actions. We are considering the sale of our Appliance Motors And U.S. Commercial and Industrial Motors businesses and will finalize this decision in August. Next slide, the summary and outlook. We had a strong quarter with good momentum as we finish out fiscal 2010. Underlying sales growth resumes, up 7%. Our underlying order trends remain positive across all five business segments, which points to two or three quarters of solid sales growth in front of us. Operating profit margin was very strong at 18%. We continue to see signs of recovery in our global end markets but expect it to be slow and steady. We will continue to make investments in next-generation technologies and expanding our global market footprint. For fiscal year 2010, we expect underlying sales to be approximately flat and net sales up 4% to 5% to $21.7 billion to $21.9 billion. Operating profit margin, 16.2% to 16.5%. Earnings per share in the range of $2.60 to $2.70. Operating cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. Free cash flow of $2.6 million to $2.7 billion. And return on total capital, ROTC, of 17% to 18%. With that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.\\nDavid Farr: Thank you very much, Lynne. I want to welcome everybody to the call. I appreciate you being with us today. As you can see that we had a very strong third quarter and continuing our recovery from what we have been undertaking the last 18 months. The people across Emerson have continued to have strong execution relative to our order pace, which is running at 18-plus percent levels on a real underlying basis. Sales now turning positive, with a positive 7% underlying growth in the third quarter, and anticipating a higher level of underlying growth in the fourth quarter as we look at the current pace of business. Operating margins at record levels. Cash flow, strong. Restructuring undertaken the last 18 months clearly starting to pay back quickly in many of our marketplaces. And then our emerging market investments, which we have been accelerating the last six months as this recovery continues, continue to benefit us from a growth standpoint and also our best cost positioning standpoint. It's pretty clear to me as I look at the industrial world, the trends are continuing to be positive. They will be moderate. These are no different trends than I anticipated as we look at our business back in early this year. We expected the business to have an inventory surge and then start slowing down, but we continue to see pretty good growth across the world. As company after company like Emerson invest in next-generation technology, they invest in their capacity, they're investing in repositioning their company and we're seeing the money being spent by companies, which have generated enormous amount of cash flow as they position themselves for this recovery. I would expect our Gross Fixed Investment indicators, which we look at, GFI, to be positive in the 4% to 5% range over the next 12 to 18 months. A very steady recovery. This is not what I would call robust or sharp recovery, but a steady recovery. And I would expect the companies out there to drive this GFI. They have the money, they're starting to spend the money and they're releasing that spending just like us. Our capital spending bottomed probably in the May time period, and if you look at our capital spending going forward, sequentially, it will continue to improve. This year, we'll probably spent somewhere around $475 million, plus or minus $5 million or $10 million. Next year, we'll spend somewhere between $575 million to $600 million, plus or minus $20 million. But clearly, the trend line is moving upwards. Our orders pace has been very strong for the last six months. Part of that is in inventory replenishment, part of it is overcorrection. But as I look at the underlying pace of that, it's still very positive. And I would expect Emerson to be, next year, above the 7% underlying sales growth level that we have in our target. Now that is still below historical recovery levels but still very positive. So I feel very comfortable right now with what's happening. I feel cautious because not every economic indicator is positive, but I also look at our space today and what's going on around the world from spending and the lack of spending for the last 18 months, it's clearly turning back to a positive mode. As I look at China, I just came back, I did a special trip, Ed Monser and I did a special trip last week to China. The China investments are continuing to flow. We are about to make some major investments in China, and I met with the people in Beijing to talk about these investments and get their support on what we want to do here. So I expect China's economy to continue to move forward. I expect us to have good growth this year. I expect us to have growth next year, maybe not at the same level but still very good growth in China. As I look at U.S.A., I look at what's going on in America right now. Industry is spending money again, which they had stopped spending and they had overcorrected. And now we'll start spending money again, which is a benefit for companies like Emerson and other industrial companies in the space. Same thing is going to happen in Europe. Europe had gone through two very, very difficult years. I expect Europe to now see some growth from a spending standpoint, modest growth. And I also expect the benefit of a weaker euro in the $1.30 to $1.35 range to help some of the key export markets coming out of Germany and other markets like that. So as I look at the markets around the world right now, the only market I feel nervous about are the Middle East and Eastern Europe. These two markets I think will struggle next year. I also feel very good about Brazil, all parts of Latin America. I feel good about the Americas in general, and I feel good about parts of Western Europe and I feel good about parts of Asia in total. So right now, the trend line momentum are pretty good. It will be not a normal recovery, but it will still be a positive recovery. And the key thing for us is, as we went through the restructuring starting in mid-2008, and really accelerating out through all of 2009 and the first part of 2010, we've got our position really strong from a cost standpoint, the emerging markets standpoint and now we're getting the benefits of that. I would anticipate that we will continue to have very nice leverage as we move forward here in this type of growth environment from the standpoint of our capacity, our cost position and a moderate growth environment. So I like this type of environment and I've mentioned that to you before because I believe that we can execute extremely well with this type of growth. As you look at our profitability, we've delivered very strong record levels of profitability in Q3. I expect us to have very good levels of profitability in Q4. And as we move into 2011, I expect us to also increase our profitability. And as I've mentioned in February, I believe we are en route to set a new level of the 17-plus percent operating profit margin. And I wouldn't be surprised, based on what I see right now, we don't move to that level in 2011. As we go forward and look at the repositioning, we look at our new product efforts. I look at selling some of our lower margin businesses. We're getting out of some of our lower margin businesses by not taking that business onward, disinvesting that. We have continued to position the company for better levels of gross profit, better levels of profitability and we have our global price/cost and a very good position at this right time. Pretty much neutral. This year, net material inflation has been negative. We'd been able to deal with that from a price-cost standpoint. Next year, I think it's going to be neutral, maybe slightly positive in net material inflation but not a big number. So it's well in focus right now as we look at going forward into 2011. As I look at it from an operating standpoint, from a standpoint of executing at the plant level, from productivity, from a working capital standpoint, the company is running at levels that we have not seen for a long time. Our trade working capital percent to sales record levels this quarter, we are record level for the second half this year. Days in the cash cycle, record levels for the quarter, been a record level for the whole year. Inventory days on hand set a record level in June, and I expect that trend to continue as we move forward here into the second half of this year going to next year. So as I look at where we sit right now, operationally-wise, the folks out there are executing for the shareholders. We are driving higher levels of underlying growth, both in order standpoint and sales standpoint. We're driving very good profit conversions, and we're investing in the emerging markets for future growth and we're investing in new generation technologies. So I like the position. The other thing that's been very good to me from this standpoint, even with the return to growth, I believe that we could set a record level of free cash flow this year and actually get very close to $2.7 billion despite from a standpoint of having to start investing back into the balance sheet. The operations have continued to do extremely good jobs in this area. So as I look at where we sit going forward for the next 30 to 60 days, we have a couple of acquisitions and divestitures we have to get done. I really can't talk a lot about it right now. In Chloride, they still have their Shareholders Meeting on August 9. We anticipate a positive outcome. We anticipate closing sometime in September, and there will be onetime closing cost as we look at inventory, as we look at some of the write-offs that we have to deal with from a standpoint of closing cost, investment costs. And as we get that shareholder vote as we move into August, as we move towards the end of August, getting sure that we're going to close in September, we will communicate what that onetime number will be. We will let you know. Right now, it's not in our forecast but it will flow in and flow out. And obviously, from a comparison standpoint, it's something that's not really relevant as we move into the 2011 time period. We also have two divestitures underway right now. Divestiture of LANDesk, which we anticipate to be closed sometime in September. We'll tell you what that means as we finalize that. And we have the final evaluation of our U.S. Motors Industrial Market business and also our Appliance Components business, which we would also anticipate we'll make a decision here in the next week or so, and then would anticipate if we move forward, that would close sometime this quarter. There'll be some pluses and minuses, and we will let you know what those are as soon as we have a good handle on them. I don't want to put numbers out there just from a speculation standpoint until we have a good idea what they are, but there will be some pluses and some minuses and we'll communicate those. And as I look at it, this is just going to wash into that fourth quarter and they'll come out, and they won't be actually part of the comparison as we go forward here into 2011. But clearly, as I've gotten a look at Chloride, I'm very excited about the opportunities here. I think we're going to have a very strong global franchise with our current business, and it will be very positive as we go forward, as we do the integration of the two businesses, assuming we get a positive shareholder vote on August 9. From the perspective of acquisitions, last year, we did $1 billion. This year, we're doing $3 billion. From what I look at 2011, I would anticipate that number to be under $1 billion, to be more in line probably $0.5 billion, around the $500 million level. I would expect our share repurchase program, which this year is running at about $100 million to be somewhere between $102 million based on what I see from our cash flow standpoint at this point in time. And I expect our capital, as I said earlier, next year to be somewhere in the $575 million to $600 million. We will also look at -- we're potentially looking, do we want to sell off one other our business, which we have earmarked as I told you. We looked at anticipating selling somewhere between $1 billion and $2 billion over the 2010 to 2012 time period, and I would look at probably doing one more sometime in 2011. Not a big business, somewhere in the $100 million to $200 million range. As we go into 2011, we have very good momentum. Our order pace has continued to be strong. We have, I think, a slightly improving economic momentum. It's mixed. From the industrial standpoint, it's good. People have held back their investments and we no longer can do that. We're going to have to start investing and we're seeing that. I like the shape of our business as we continue to invest in emerging markets. Those markets are going to grow. I also see that we'll see some sustained recovery in our mature markets both here in U.S. and in Europe. And I think to reposition the company will benefit us from the standpoint of the markets we serve as we move into 2011 to drive a pretty good underlying growth rate. And as I said, I would anticipate at this point in time looking at where I look at today, our underlying growth rate to be above the 5% to 7% range, which will be a good thing for us to do. If you look at the last recovery, it'll be a lot higher than that, but we clearly are on a different recovery. So as I look at today, I'm extremely pleased with the people across this company and the execution for the last two years. We are now delivering what I would say a very strong above average growth, profitability and cash flow conversion, the momentum is good across this company. I like where we sit from a restructuring standpoint, we will do less restructuring next year, probably in the $120 million to $130 million range. But we still have restructuring to get done across the world, as we continue to position ourselves for best cost and for growth in emerging markets. And we will have some positive tailwinds. Our long-term compensation program will not double up next year. It will be a single plan, which will help us. I do anticipate interest rates will stay low, which in my theory, a mild pension headwind, but I mean, mild pension headwind. Not something I'm worried about too much at this point in time. As I sit right now, I feel good about closing out this year. The Board today reviewed where we sit relative to this year and the next six months, and I think that we had a very positive conversation relative to the momentum we have created with the company right now. And the job one for us is continue to grow the new products, continue to invest in that future, continue to invest in emerging markets and continue to execute at higher levels of profitability to take this company to levels not seen before, as we committed to you, shareholders, back in February. So with that, I want to close and say, thank you very much, across the organization for the commitment you gave us the last six months and particularly this quarter. We look forward to a strong close, and we look forward to a strong 2011. I thank everyone for joining us and look forward to answering any questions I feel are appropriate. Thank you very much.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\\nDavid Farr: [Operator Instructions]\\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley.\\nScott Davis - Morgan Stanley: Can you talk a little bit about these big margins though? I mean, coming back, I went back and looked at about 10 years of data, I don't think we've ever seen incrementals at this magnitude. And obviously, last year's restructuring is really paying off. So what do you think about sustainability and kind of that balance between making additional investments and keeping those margins up?\\nDavid Farr: There's a couple of things going on as we look and analyze from a profitability standpoint. The repositioning, the restructuring has really helped us from a cost standpoint, plus we've been repositioning into businesses, which generate higher levels of margin and we're moving away from lower margin, so that helps us a little bit. The second thing that helped us, and it's very, very difficult to anticipate or quantify how much it means to us. But if you remember, Scott, last year, we were greatly decreasing inventory. We took out about $700 million in inventory, as our sales dropped. We've got that inventory out by the end of the fiscal year, and then our business has stabilized from the standpoint of our run rate and our inventory. And so now as we move into a growth mode for production, we are replenishing and building inventory live, and we're building it in very low-cost, best-cost locations, and that productivity is really helping. That's helping us a little bit. In the third quarter, there's two other things that helped us that I would say gave us, what I would say, an extraordinary margin at the 18% level. Number one, from the perspective of currency, the currency markets swung a little bit on a transactional standpoint. And because of the way the euro moved from very strong to very weak, it gave us the benefit of some of our transactional hedging that we do at a divisional level that gave us a margin improvement, in particular companies like the Process business got this benefit. But as I look at the fundamentals right now, and I look at this fundamental margin, I fundamentally believe as I said to you in February, we will drive this peak above 17%. We are not cutting corners relative to our long-term investments. It's just that we are fundamentally mixing the business to give us a higher margin and allow us to sustain that and still have sustainable investments. So there's a lot of things going our way right now this quarter. Not as many will go that way next quarter, so typically our third to fourth quarter, we'd see margin expansion. I think it will be very good for us, if we have a flat margin or a slightly tick up higher margin, as I look at that fourth quarter based on what benefits we had in the third quarter. But I like where we are right now. We're running at levels unseen ever at Emerson.\\nScott Davis - Morgan Stanley: Dave, you mentioned you just got back from China and are making bigger investments there. Can you give us maybe a state of the union on what you're seeing in the local environment there and sustainability and that will be my last question.\\nDavid Farr: From the perspective of China, I think the market is still going to -- we're going to still pretty good growth. It slowing down. The government's clearly modulating what they're going to invest in. I think the economic growth will still be very positive next year. We are making investments primarily in the Process business, our Climate business, some of our Industrial business and a bit on one of our Storage businesses and some unique positioning that we want to go after the mid-tier market in China and both for China, but also expanding across Asia Pacific. So I think the China market right now, it's clearly slowing. I still feel okay about it. As we move into next year, I think it will continue to slow but we'll still -- I think, we'll still drive maybe 8%, 9%, 10%, 11% in China. I am not worried about China at this point in time.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.\\nSteven Winoker - Bernstein Research: The first one is, just trying to get a sense for what's changed and improved in your outlook or what's driven the improvement over the last since I think the beginning of June, when you look at sort of Europe and the macro situation in Europe and the U.S. and the impact that would have on China. What I'm hearing in this call, is really just more concern about the Middle East, but frankly more positive sentiment around these other areas.\\nDavid Farr: I think that from the U.S. standpoint, the economic stability is there from the industrial world as we had cut back so deeply for so long. And now as the companies decided, okay, we need to invest in productivity. We need to invest in some incremental capacity. We need to do certain things for new products. That momentum is going to continue, and we have the cash to be able to do that. If you open the balance sheet of most of our customers in this space, they're very strong. And many of these customers have global businesses, which are now improving and they're starting to export. So that is changed in the last, I would say, the last 90 days, that has continued. I expect that modest momentum to continue. I'm not looking for sharp, sharp numbers recovery, but a modest type of recovery. And it's clearly concerned at all times is something that is going to hiccup that. But at this point in time, just looking at my own investments that we're doing internally, which we held off. We now are to the point that as we restructured, repositioned, we need to make incremental investments both from a technology, from new products and capacity standpoint. In Europe, they've gone through very difficult two-year time period. The governments are attacking. I think there are issues relative to some of their cost positions, their debt positions. And with the weaker euro, even at the $1.30, $1.35 level, they have become a stronger export engine around the world and we will benefit from that as we look at the order pace. And so I would anticipate Europe to have a very nice recovery, even though the economic numbers may not be that robust. So that's my view of this right now. And I think that companies feel comfortable, our customers feel comfortable and they're starting to invest. If there's a change, we'll see that in the next 60 to 90 days. But if you look at our order pace, our order pace on a month-by-month basis has continued to sequentially get better. I anticipate within the next two months, this month here or the next month, that pace will start slowing down. But I still think it's going to move down towards that 8%, 9% level, as we look at where things are going at this point in time. It's a modest recovery but a recovery that is supported by companies that have the cash and the investment needs to be made.\\nSteven Winoker - Bernstein Research: I guess from a capital perspective, you talked in the prior call about looking for return of invested capital framework kind of having this 9% to 11% for strategic acquisition. I know you can't go into too much detail, but how are you thinking about that in the context of Chloride?\\nDavid Farr: We will beat that. We will beat it.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.\\nEli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Can we talk specifically about the big -- Climate Technologies had a huge volume gains, certainly bigger than what I expected, phenomenal margins and I don't think we've ever seen that. What's driving that? And what caused that big step up from profitability? You're talking about sustainability but this is a new level for that part of the business.\\nDavid Farr: There's a couple of things going on. You'll remember probably two or three years ago, that we made the decision to move forward and create some very best-cost manufacturing locations in the Climate business. We did that both in Eastern Europe, we did that in -- we expanded in China, we expanded in Thailand and we built our new facility in Mexico. We obviously got hit with that in the downturn, and I took the blame for that because I made the decision to move forward. We are now getting this tremendous benefit of that cost structure as we recovers. That's helping us. We made the investments, we made the decision to reposition. And now we're getting the benefit of that cost structure. Secondly, if you look at all of the markets, we had gone for three years, what I would say, challenging markets in the space and people had to start buying it again, and so we saw a recovery. Even if the housing markets not recovering, people had to make investments in their heating and cooling systems, and we get the benefit of that. Even if they don't replace the whole system, we get the benefit of it from a compressor and a technology standpoint. And the third thing is as the efficiencies have changed and they've had to go into more higher-level of scroll or higher level of electronics and higher end type of products, that's a good mix both from our customer, and then also from our self. From a standpoint of higher dollar values, we get that benefit for growth and also higher profitability. So we've had a lot of good things come our way here in the last 12 months. I anticipate the business still will be good, but the growth rates will moderate, and we'll have to try to invest. We could start seeing some of mix change in the margin a little bit, but we have set a new level of profitability like we did in Process. And I believe it will be one of these nice levels that we stood out there. We're drip back down and things slow down, but it's a nice level of profitability.\\nEli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: You didn't use the China standards that went into this part of this thing, was that a major deal in the quarter.\\nDavid Farr: I mean, for my perspective, that started a year ago. It definitely was a help. There was no doubt about it. It was part of the whole efficiency standards, I said improvement. So we have that going on in Europe, in the United States and in China. So all those things helped us from that mix standpoint, and we have a market recovery. This business will cycle from quarter-to-quarter, but right now, it's been in a pretty good sweet spot for the last 12 months. It started recovering at this time last year, so we're now starting getting the tougher comparisons, but the management team has executed extremely well in new products. They brought a lot of new technology into play, and we have the best, best cost locations in the world now for this business.\\nEli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC: Something in Process Management, the 20.6% margin you've got, that mix from MRO plus you mentioned currency, was that a percentage of the margin? And will that go back down a little bit towards the high teens with more likely in the future.\\nDavid Farr: For my perspective, we have the couple of things going on our way in the process world. The Process Management team did a great job starting, mid last year, restructuring, and they really got behind it and got it done and we're seeing that benefit. Two, we did get a benefit from currency. In the quarter, they are clearly one of our more international companies in particular in Europe and they had some transactional hedging, which moved our way. Some quarters that moves our way, some quarter moves against us, right? This quarter move for us that did help us from a margin standpoint. Third, MRO was really strong in North America. Again, as companies had held off last year, they started spending. And the large projects really haven't started kicking in yet, which will start kicking in probably in the first half of 2011. And I anticipate the profit margins in Process to stay at pretty good levels, and maybe in the 18% to 20% level here as we go forward here the next couple of quarters. But you know, this business has run a 20% build out before. People always question can we do it. We invest a lot of money, we have a very good mix of our business, and we are also very aggressive relative to repositioning our cost base. So we drive hard to deliver this 18% to 20% operating profit margins in this business, and I think we can continue to do that.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Merrill Lynch.\\nJohn Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Dave, just picking up on Climate, I want to get your thoughts in terms of the hot weather that Northeast has been experiencing the last few weeks. Has that played into the results into any meaningful degree? And perhaps if not this quarter, what about the September quarter and maybe a little bit of potential channel fill or inventory restock or something like that?\\nDavid Farr: I think the channel right now in supplying this industry, the supplier base is probably stressed as far as you can go. I don't think there's much upside. I think what it means is hot weather. We'll liquidate inventory, which will allow us to stay stronger probably in the first four, five months in the next fiscal year. We've been running very strong. I think right now as I look at what's going on in the supply chain out there, I think there's some tension. That means some of the guys are having struggle to keep up. We're not having any problems at this point in time because we put the capacity on two or three years ago, but there are other people that are having trouble keeping up. We're not the only supplier to the HVAC industry. And so I would anticipate the hot weather will liquidate inventory. I anticipate that we will not see a lot of surges in the upside right now. I think we'll see a stronger first fiscal quarter or fourth calendar quarter because of the liquidation of inventory. That's what I see at this point in time.\\nJohn Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then thinking about that timeline, Dave, where does your capacity stand? I know you talked about Eastern Europe and Mexico. I mean, if you do see a surge later, call it in fiscal '11, are you prepared to meet that upside demand or are you having to look to put capacity in there, where does that stand?\\nDavid Farr: Right now, one more reason I took my trip to China is because we are about to put -- expanding China both from a manufacturing of compressors, but also for the next-generation technology investments. I want making sure we get protected, which I've got the commitment. So we will be protected, and we will be significantly expanding Xuzhou relative to technology and all manufacturing. We're also putting expansion in Mexico at this point in time, and so we are already looking into 2012. I'm okay for 2011. From our perspective, John, in this industry, we look out about two to three years. And so I'm already making investments for 2012 and 2013. We're okay.\\nJohn Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch: Industrial Automation, the volume levels, if you think of sort of the run rate, Dave, they're so much below where they were at the peak. I'm just thinking kind of once we get through the whole comps issue, we're rolling into next year, shouldn't that business be running on an order rate perspective kind of above the 8-ish percent that you think the underlying company can do? How do you think about that business basically going forward?\\nDavid Farr: John, your observations are right on the mark. This business has went really deep, and I think we'll continue to run at very high levels here probably for 18 to 24 months. It will modulate at the high end of our growth rate in the recovery mode, which is starting to kick in to right now. And so as I look at the investments around a little bit, the type of investments we're in. I think it's going to be pretty good market place for us. And that will allow us -- I think it's still going to take three or four years to get back to levels that we were in 2008. But I think because of our restructuring, our profitability is going to come back much faster.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.\\nRichard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Question on projects. In terms of what you're seeing out there, do you expect a surge here once we get into the fall, where companies feel better about 2011 and the spending really picks up or just going to be kind of more gradual in terms of, I think, pick up.\\nDavid Farr: I think it will be more gradual. We're seeing, there are a handful, probably 10, let's say, very large projects around the world, primarily in emerging market like Brazil. Several large ones is going on in Brazil, couple in India, couple in China. Most of the projects we see right now, what I'd call small medium-size, not the $100 million to $200 million level projects, but more to $10 million to $25 million level projects. And I don't think we're going to see a surge. I think we're going to see a gradual improvement. We're seeing that going on right now. We see that both in Process, I see that in Industrial and I see that in Network Power. The activity level is increasing and getting stronger as people get more and more comfortable relative to the investments they're going to make. So I feel right now based on talking to CEOs around the world, they have the money, they've held back. And so therefore, they're going to start inching this capital out like we're doing right now with a little bit improvement every quarter. And as long as they're getting the payback, and let's say in the growth, they're going to keep going this way. So that's why I feel reasonably comfortable that we're going to see a modest recovery. I feel modestly optimistic about it, and I like our cost position. I like where our position, a global basis. That's where my basis comes from for this recovery, not some economic models.\\nRichard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: On Climate, I don't recall seeing Commercial being mentioned as an area of strength here recently. What are you seeing there, are you more encouraged with what you're seeing on the Commercial side as it relates to Climate?\\nDavid Farr: The answer is yes. Commercial has continued to improve both here in the U.S. and also in Asia. And I think we're going to start seeing improvement in Europe starting about now. And one of that -- because the Commercial business in Europe has also been in our investment for the last couple of years, and you're going to see some of the market places, in particular, the export market places the Western Europe surge will be better. So I think our Climate business is going to shift a little bit here. It's going to go from less residential, less of that area to more commercial as that growth rate modulates and that will help us also from a profitability standpoint.\\nRichard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Supply-chain and Network Powers, and discussion around some supply-chain issues, what are you seeing when do you think that gets fixed up?\\nDavid Farr: And along the electronic component area, primarily the active electronic component area, I see this first sign of stabilizing. I believe that it will probably take into the rest of this calendar year, early couple of months of 2011, but I start seeing it stabilized now as the capacities coming on from the suppliers there. And clearly, we could have more sales, but I think it's going to take us a lot to get our work through there.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\\nChristopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Dave, you mentioned the Climate Tech margins being kind of reset along the lines of the Process Management in the past. Can you give a little bit of a framework for thinking about how Network Power might come along into that solutions higher margin pathway overtime.\\nDavid Farr: Yes, as I've talked about before, historically, our Network Power business would go down to that 8% to 9%, and move it's way up, say, the 13%, 14%. I believe the work we're undertaking right now and with the acquisition of Chloride, that range is going to be -- we will drive above 15% as we get into the peaks of those recovery. It may take us -- there's a couple of more years before that recovery happens, but I believe that we're trying to drive this business to be in the 10% to 15% level. And I think that's where we're going to go from that range. And I would like to see in this cycle get to that 15% level which we've not reached before on an annual basis.\\nChristopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And then for the segment margins, it was called out in each slide, the significant cost reduction benefits, just wondering if you have some cost containment strategies that are not really sustainable and some things coming back into the cost structure.\\nDavid Farr: We don't do that stuff. We take our actions. I mean, and also during -- and cut people's pension costs. We're a company that makes money, I don't do things like that. I don't sit there, and say okay, we're not going to fund your 401(k). I call those one-time cost, we didn't do that last year, and we clearly not doing that this year. I mean, we're a company that makes money. I think we can afford to pay our people.\\nChristopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Process, seasonal step down into the beginning of the fiscal year. Do you expect that to be a little muted, given what you're seeing?\\nDavid Farr: I think we are processes in the mode of recovery and what that cycle looks like, this is an unusual cycle in many of our businesses. So I'd be very careful about mapping the cycles right now for a while. I mean, I'm struggling with myself and I run the business. I think you're going to see a pretty good first half for Process, which will probably not be the same type of mode that we've seen normally in the cycle right now because we're coming out of it. And the question is what's the mix of those projects, what's the mix of the MRO and where is it coming from. But right now, I'd say the momentum is pretty good for unusual first half for process.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Crédit Suisse.\\nJulian Mitchell: The first one is on your Asia business outside China because your China business, I don't see it grew much more than Asia, overall. So I just want what was happening within your Asia business? I saw you said the Process is down 19% in Asia, Appliance and Tools is down 2%. So I just wondered if you could give more clarity on Asia x china.\\nDavid Farr: I think, the first question, Julian, I think there's a lot of projects that's going in and out, and we had a phenomenal last year Process in Asia. So the business moves around from quarter-to-quarter. There's nothing unusual there other than that we went to a period that we have some very large projects that shipped last year and we have a period, a very little order pace. Now the order pace is going positive, and we're starting to replenish that. So it's a lumpy business in Process in particular in Asia and Latin America. So there's nothing really hard you can get out of that, but I can tell you the pace has picked up in orders in Asia for Process. The other one is Appliance and Tools?\\nJulian Mitchell: Just within Asia, but prices on Appliance and Tools were down so I was just asking about...\\nDavid Farr: Things moving in and out, I mean, the process is far more important in Asia in Appliance and Tools. By the way if I'm going to win the bet or you're going to win the bet.\\nJulian Mitchell: Based on your comment I thought the CapEx seems to be rebounding quite quickly now?\\nDavid Farr: Yes, but I think we had a bet at the second half. It would be 5.80, and I even gave you the calendar second half. I think I know the numbers. I think you're going to owe me $20 partner.\\nJulian Mitchell: The other one was just the SG&A to sales ratio. That was sort of flat year-on-year and came down a bit from the first half to Q3. I guess, that you'll grow that sort of in line with your revenues when you're talking about the investments in emerging markets and so on, just how you see SG&A to sales from here. Because obviously, order growth is running far of your revenue growth. So I wondered if your OpEx growth would start to catch up with your order growth or you'll keep it in pace with revenues?\\nDavid Farr: I wouldn't be a surprised next year or SG&A doesn't go up from the mix of business as the higher GP margin business and Network Power kicks back in for sales as the higher GP margin business for Process kicks back. They both have higher SG&A. So my gut tells me next year or SG&A might tick up a tenth or two if the same time our GP margin ticks up. So if the mix goes on a little bit right now, the mix helps us, to be honest, for SG&A this year, next year it's going to move against us. But I would expect our SG&A to move in line with sales and maybe a little bit faster in sales as Network Power and as Process kicks back in.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.\\nTerry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I appreciate the color on '11, and I just want to follow-up a couple of points there. One, wondering if, well, I think we probably cross the line asking a lot of detail about Chloride accretion dilution at this point, but maybe if you think about all the acquisition carryover into '11 and net debt with the divestiture picture that you know of, how do we calibrate kind of the acquisition impact all in both revenues and EPS in '11 if we can do that at this point in '11?\\nDavid Farr: It's a little bit early. I think from the sales standpoint, we'll be okay. I mean, the Motor business that we're looking at selling is about $800 million. So that will come out if we make the decision to go forward that, that will come out. But then we've got other businesses. Chloride is going to run around $500 million, a little bit of $550 million in sales and we've done some of the acquisitions. So I think the sales standpoint, we'll be okay. I mean, fundamentally, what I would factor in, right now, and we're just starting this process. My opinion would be the 2010 acquisitions will be slightly EPS dilutive to us. I mean, Chloride will be based on what you can see the numbers and also we will be taking out the Motor business which did make money though not high level with the profitability. So that will also hurt us. We will lay it out for you as soon as we get this in focus and share it with the board. But overall, for us to deal is we're going to have great underlying performance, which we talked about. And then we have a couple of negative things we have to deal with, and then we have a positive headwinds. And we got some things going our way and some things going against us. So I mean, I expect a pretty good year next year based on what I see at this point in time.\\nTerry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then also a follow-up on your 2011 commentary around the margins, I think you said 17% plus if you calibrate the fourth quarter at 18%, a little over 18%. It's kind of a 16.5% for the year. And if we put the acquisition effect aside for a moment, I mean, 30% incrementals will get you over 18% versus over 17%, maybe that's just the way you're scoping it out, not trying to be as precise as I'm trying to be, but why on the underlying basis might be a 30% in incremental margins, not be pretty doable next year?\\nDavid Farr: I think they will be pretty doable, but we have to factor in all the acquisitions and divestitures going in there. There's no doubt that the margin will be above 17% next year. The question is there going to be 17.1% to 17.5%, and that's a little bit early to be in that call, but we're going to set a record-level margin next year based on what I see right now, assuming the other line growth continues to happen as a see it.\\nTerry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Can you talk about the data center cycle as you see it, both in terms of how you think you're doing versus peers here in the near term. But how long do you think this very strong level of demand on the data center build out can continue?\\nDavid Farr: The data centers has an interesting thing. Obviously, inquiries and order pace is turning positive right now. I don't think there's been any major shifts amongst the major players at this point in time. If you look back at late 2008, early 2009, that business continue to do very well because it's a longer cycle business. They put the capacity online, now they're absorbing that capacity. Now they're starting to see that they're going to need more incremental capacity as the leave '10 and going to 2011. So I think the cycle which usually runs four or five years is just starting to kick back in, and it should be a pretty good cycle as we start going into 2011. I don't think there's been any fundamental shift relative to the market positions. There's so many moving parts out there when the company talks about that, and there's no real -- no one reports a clear number. But based on what I know of the market place, I think we're all starting to recover. We're all going to start doing pretty good as the market continues to get strong and stronger.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert Cornell with Barclays Capital.\\nRobert Cornell - Barclays Capital: Where were you playing this new technology or the center, this largest flow labs in the U.S. or someplace else?\\nDavid Farr: That's in Marshalltown, and from Iowa, it's where our Brain Trust is relative to technology for control valves for new career industry or some of the high-end LNG facility, some of the most sophisticated valve technology will stay in this country.\\nRobert Cornell - Barclays Capital: That brings a point up on Climate, you mentioned you're putting compressor manufacturing in China but you were able to protect the IP assuming that how you're doing that and what's different.\\nDavid Farr: Because I have a good relationship with the people over there, and I don't go running off talking to papers, 31 years, Bob, and we have a very good relationship. China respects IP. If you actually have the patent protection, you own the patent protection, you filed it and protect it, they will support you. We are 29 for 30 in all our patent litigation there, and they know it's the economic weapons. So there going to -- I feel very comfortable with what we're going to do, right now, and trying to protect our growth initiatives and if you don't play, you will not be playing in China in 10 years from now.\\nRobert Cornell - Barclays Capital: In terms of your investment spending, Dave, I mean, where are you in the run rate, and how much is it going to come up? And can you give us a feel for what kind of dollars we're talking about here or some way to calibrate it? For the growth spending.\\nDavid Farr: For what?\\nRobert Cornell - Barclays Capital: Growth spending.\\nDavid Farr: I don't break that out. I mean, we don't break that out. I mean, we're investing pretty aggressively right now even with the high levels of margins and primarily investing in the emerging markets from that type of capability and for the new product standpoint, we're investing across the company. So I mean, we're going to have a very good year as we move in, it's 2011. There's a lot of new products come out. I don't break out that type. I can see that at a competitive sense, so I don't do that.\\nRobert Cornell - Barclays Capital: A little more color on Industrial Automation, it sounds like the order is real strong. You haven't really decided on that business here on the call. You're buying, but sounds like a business for EPT in Brazil, can you give some color around that business and EPT and Control Techniques and what else is going on there?\\nDavid Farr: Industrial businesses are starting to come back around the world, and so the business we want in Brazil is actually for EGF, and it has the IEC technology which we really didn't have a lot of IEC technology. It's a nice flow business. From my perspective, people are going to start spending money they had under invested. They have taken a lot of capacity off-line as they reposition, and now the people are starting to spend money, I think you're going to see a gradual recovery as I said on the phone. I think this is going forward over the next two or three years, but our cost position is pretty good. And I think we'll see a pretty good growth here in industrial space, and all the industrial companies will do pretty well here for at least 12 to 18 months as this continues recovery. I feel good about this.\\nRobert Cornell - Barclays Capital: Do I hear regular comments, saying, the orders there, we're tracking up 45%. Did I misunderstand that number?\\nDavid Farr: That was a correct number.\\nRobert Cornell - Barclays Capital: That sounds like more than a gradual recovery.\\nDavid Farr: Well, you have an inventory -- you got to think about where it came from, it came from debt, it came from like zero. And so it's going to be a high level of numbers, and it will slip it's way back down. So we just want to give you a nag, to let you know that we actually do have a pretty good growth in this company unlike what you think.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.\\nNigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: Just want to calibrate on the comments on the 4Q margins. I think you talked about modest expansion was that a Q-over-Q or year-over-year, Dave?\\nDavid Farr: For the fourth quarter?\\nNigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: Yes.\\nDavid Farr: I think our fourth quarter margin is going to be pretty close to what it was in the third quarter. Third quarter had some help from the standpoint, a couple of things as I said, we had great mix, we had the currency helping us a little bit from that margin. And so I think typically, going third to fourth, it will be up. I think today, I think our third to fourth, sequentially, third to fourth will probably be at the same level of profitability, a very, very high level. As someone pointed out earlier, I'm not backing off investments. I'm not interested inflating margins just to deflate margins.\\nNigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: And then secondly, you talked about the Network Power supply-chain shortage. I mean, the gap between orders growth and organic growth has been a pretty wide for two quarters now. It implies that there's some nice backlog builds in that business. I'm just wondering once we get beyond the supply-chain shortages, should we expect a big surge in core growth?\\nDavid Farr: I think you should see, as I've been telling my guys, I expect some pretty good underlying growth once we get things down, assuming there is not double orders going on out there, which you never can tell which I bet there are. But I expect some pretty good underlying growth to catch up that backlog and to catch up that order pace has been going on. The answer is yes.\\nNigel Coe - Deutsche Bank AG: Finally, just on the mode of business, if you listen to the press, I mean, it sounds like this Process has been if process for quite some time. What's been the big delay in terms of filling this up, is it price? Is it structure?\\nDavid Farr: And first of all, there's a rumor that Crompton was bidding on the something, which is not true. That rumor is not true. We don't even have a Transformer business and I assume this as you know. It's been going on because there's been a very, very strong interest, so there was a lot of participants. We are now narrowing it down to a couple, and we're going to be making decisions here, I would say in the next 10 days. But that's where we are. So we're moving to a closure.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Surrell [ph] with Conning Asset Management.\\nUnidentified Analyst: Your short-term debt went up about $1 billion from the March quarter. I was just curious what drove that.\\nDavid Farr: We have to put money up for Chloride, part of the U.K. takeover rules is you have to have money in the bank ready to do Chloride when you make the offer.\\nUnidentified Analyst: So it's not just commercial paper borrowings?\\nDavid Farr: You got it.\\nUnidentified Analyst: And once that closes, you just going to draw down your cash balances, you're not going to issue new debt to fund that.\\nDavid Farr: We're going to draw down our cash balance, and we happen to generate pretty close to $3 billion operating cash a year. So I'd say we'd paying off within six months over international markets.\\nOperator: Mr. Tusa your line is open.\\nC. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: What do you see -- your revenue comp, I think in the U.S. were where they in North America HVAC?\\nDavid Farr: Pretty good.\\nC. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Obviously better than the kind of mid-teens the OEMs are reporting, right?\\nDavid Farr: Correct.\\nC. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Is that kind of an ongoing replace versus -- or fixed versus replace dynamic there?\\nDavid Farr: You got it.\\nC. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Pretty dramatic, these consumers are just not going. Is that more a function of how expensive the new systems are or what you guys sense around or just generally the high unemployment?\\nDavid Farr: I think there's three things. One, people are very concerned because they don't have a job or they may lose a job, so they're being very concerned about how much they want to spend for a whole new system. Two, there's a shock in awe, when the guy walks up and says, why need this much space to install your new high-efficiency units. After you hit the ground and throw water on. They wake you up, you started to say, I don't have that type of space to put it in. So there's shocking effect. And the third thing really boils down to as people realizing that they can just replace components sometimes and keep the system going for another two or three years, and they're going to do that in this type of environment. So it's a good thing for us.\\nC. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: How concerned are you that the guys in Washington don't approve something that's comparable to the $1,500 tax credit? Is that a factor in how we think about next year? I know there's irrelevant?\\nDavid Farr: Irrelevant.\\nC. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Irrelevant for you guys, I guess, but for the industry irrelevant?\\nDavid Farr: I personally think tax didn't do squat other than full stop forward for six months and then you have the big hole. So...\\nC. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Are you worried for the big hole for the OEMs next year because of that?\\nDavid Farr: We'll see. I'm not too worried about it.\\nC. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just on the Appliance and Tools business has gone through a little bit of a facelift. Anything else in the portfolio that sub-sized it, you're looking to kind of swap out of here over the next couple of years?\\nDavid Farr: There will be more businesses in the Appliance and Tools section that will be sold over the next two to three years. But as I said earlier, I don't anticipate anything of substance next year. I'm looking at one business or two businesses in the $100 million to $200 million range. Nothing aside at this point in time. We will find a way for a container recovery to happen there.\\nC. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co: When will you be able to talk again, when the deal is done?\\nDavid Farr: Yes, I think when the deal is done. That's right. With that, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Again, I want to thank all the people out there at Emerson from the standpoint of great execution. And as I said, I'm very pleased where we sit right now, and I'm projecting pretty good momentum as we move into the next six to nine months. Thank you very much, and have a great rest of the summer.

       "'Executives: Matt Cribbins – Vice President-Investor Communications Jeff Immelt – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Keith Sherin – Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer-GE Capital Jeff Bornstein – Chief Financial Officer\\nAnalysts: Scott Davis – Barclays Deane Dray – RBC Capital Markets Steven Winoker – Bernstein Nigel Coe – Morgan Stanley Shannon OCallaghan – UBS Julian Mitchell – Credit Suisse Joe Ritchie – Goldman Sachs Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer Robert McCarthy – Stifel Jeffrey Sprague – Vertical Research\\nOperator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Ellen and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like turn the program over to your host for today’s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.\\nMatt Cribbins: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings webcast. We issued the press release, presentation, and supplemental earlier this morning on our website at www.ge.com/investor. As always, elements of this presentation are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. For today’s webcast, we have Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; Vice Chairman and CEO of GE Capital, Keith Sherin; and our CFO, Jeff Bornstein. Now, I’ll turn it over to Jeff Immelt.\\nJeff Immelt: Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. The GE team had a good quarter and a slow growth in volatile environment. Organic performance was strong, and industrial revenue growth was up 4%, profit was up 9%, year-to-date industrial CFOA is up 23%, and industrial segment margins were up 100 basis points. Let me make a few comments on we’re seeing our markets more broadly. The U.S. is still okay and Europe is appreciably better. Meanwhile, growth markets are facing some headwinds in resource pricing and currency. Nonetheless, we’re positioned to win some big fourth quarter deals in these markets in locomotives and power, aviation, and power conversion, which should support our growth objectives; and service provides a great buffer in times of uncertainty. We made substantial progress on GE’s portfolio transformation in the quarter. Alstom has been approved by the European Commission and we expect this to close soon. The Fed has approved the Synchrony separation, and we expect to commence the share exchange next week. The net effect of this should be to return about $20 billion to investors in the form of share reduction. Our GE Capital portfolio sales are ahead of plan; and with the Wells announcement, we now expect 2015 signings of $140 billion to $150 billion. And we believe this will facilitate an incremental dividend from GE Capital of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter or $3 billion for the year. So if you look at our execution, we’re tracking to meet or beat all of our critical goals. We’re reconfirming our earnings outlook that we gave in the second quarter, when we boosted the low end of our range. And our CFOA and cash return to investors will be at the high-end of our framework. So Keith and I will now take you through a deeper dive on the portfolio moves. For Alstom, all the major regulators have now approved GE’s purchase of Alstom with remedies. We’re comfortable with the outcome as the economic and strategic impact of the deal remains intact. We will divest to Ansaldo the GT26 new units, and the GT36 technology, and 34 of 720 service contracts in the installed base. We will retain the ability to do service for competitive units through PSM. Financially, we still expect to achieve $3 billion of synergies with $0.05 to $0.08 of earnings accretion in 2016 and $0.15 to $0.20 by 2018. Alstom grows GE’s installed base by 50%. In addition, they will substantially improve our position in renewables and grid. Alstom will achieve a strong return for investors and we will give you more operating details on Alstom at a special meeting we plan to hold in late November. Now over to Keith to give you an update on the GE Capital portfolio moves.\\nKeith Sherin: Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we have received formal approval from the Federal Reserve to move forward with the split off of Synchrony Financial as a standalone company. This is the final step in a project which we started two years ago and is a key component in the transformation of GE Capital. We can’t talk about the specific financial terms of this exchange until we launch. However to provide some context on the left side of the page, we show the timeline and mechanics for the exchange. We plan to launch the split exchange next week subject to market conditions. The offer period remains open for 20 business days from the time of launch. And at launch, we’re going to set the offer terms for the exchange, meaning the split discount that holders will receive on Synchrony stock when they exchange their GE shares plus the exchange cap ratio, which is the maximum discount between GE and Synchrony shares set at the time of the launch. The pricing for the split exchange will happen on days 16 to 18, and the offer closes on day 20, which would occur the week of November 16. Based on precedents from other exchanges that have taken place and the current stock prices of GE and Synchrony, we anticipate to receive proceeds of between $18 billion and $21 billion, which translate to a buyback of 650 million to 750 million shares in GE. The range in outcomes is determined by the split discount, the exchange ratio, and the movement of GE and Synchrony shares prior to and during the exchange up to pricing. We anticipate that we’ll record a gain in GE Capital in discontinued operations and that gain, the size of which is dependent on the final split discount will be embedded in the proceeds for the buyback, so we’ll not have any impact on GECC Capital ratios. I really like to thank Margaret Keane and her team for the terrific work they’ve done to position Synchrony for this separation. In the next 30.days, we plan to retire 6% to 7% of GE shares. Next, I’ll give you an update on our progress executing the plan that we announced on April 10th. On the top left of this chart is an update on the portfolio sales. We are ahead of plan. And in the first six months since the announcement, we’ve signed deals on $126 billion worth of ENI. Since 2Q, we’ve signed $58 billion worth of transactions, the largest being the $30 billion sale of our distribution finance, vendor finance, and direct lending businesses to Wells Fargo, which we announced earlier this week. We gave previous guidance that we would sign $120 billion to $150 billion of deals by year-end, and we’re now raising the low end of that range to $140 billion given the progress we’ve made. We have closed $60 billion of sales to date, and we’re on track to close $100 billion by year-end. On the bottom left, you can see our current view versus the goals that we established back on April 10. We’re ahead of plan on asset sales and we expect to largely be done with our exits by year-end 2016 instead of 2017. Overall, we’re on track to deliver the $35 billion of capital back to the parent. You can see on the top right that our pricing to date on the $126 billion is slightly ahead of plan at 1.4 times price to tangible book. And the deal that we announced with Wells earlier this week was also at approximately 1.4 times price to tangible book. As a result of the accelerated sales, we are giving up some of the future income from the total plan. But overall, with our asset and liability management actions, including the debt exchange that we completed, our current estimate of capital to be returned is still $35 billion. In terms of timing of dividends, as we close sales transactions in the fourth quarter, we expect our Tier 1 common ratio to exceed 14%, and we plan to pay a dividend of approximately $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter subject to our governance process. That would result in $3 billion for 2015, which is $2 billion higher than the original plan. In addition, we’re on track for $18 billion of dividends that we previously said would come in 2016. Our goal is to apply for SIFI de-designation, which based on our view of transaction closings, our target is to file in the first quarter of 2016. If you combine the Synchrony split with the 2015 transaction closings, we expect to end 2015 with around $175 billion of ENI around $200 billion lower than year end 2014. I really like to thank the GE Capital employees who have accomplished a lot in the last six months, and the team is focused on substantially completing the business exits by the end of 2016. Let me turn it back to Jeff.\\nJeff Immelt: Thanks, Keith. And now I’ll briefly go through GE’s industrial operations. Year-to-date orders are down 4% organically. We faced some tough comps in orders compared to third quarter 2014, when total orders grew by 22%, and equipment orders grew by 31%. Organically, developed markets are up 18% year-to-date with growth markets down 7% excluding a large one-time GE9X order. Our year-to-date orders in China are up 1%. Service grew by 6% organically, and our progress was broad-based. PowerGen services grew by 10%, aviation spares grew by 28%, and healthcare was up by 4% organically. Power and water, energy management, and healthcare orders were up 9% organically. However, aviation and transportation has significant one-time orders placed in the third quarter of 2014 with GE9X and Tier 4. These two products alone had $6 billion of orders in the third quarter of 2014. Oil and gas orders reflect the impact of industry dynamics. Our organic orders decline was 32% and is not unexpected. We continue to compete well in the market and have not seen cancellations. Importantly, there are substantial equipment orders where we’ve been selected technically, but they have been delayed. So we’re confident in our market position. Across the company, we have a strong funnel of orders for the fourth quarter and we expect our orders performance to improve. On execution, the GE team executed very well in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was up 4% with six of seven segments up. Our relative position both in product and geographic diversity has never been stronger. Globally, revenue in the U.S. was up 5%, and Europe organic growth was up substantially, while growth markets declined by 7%. Year-to-date revenue was positive in ASEAN, China, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Middle East and North Africa. Meanwhile, reasons like Russia, Canada, and Australia have been hard hit by natural resource dynamics. Services were up 8% organically. Growth for software and analytics was up 16%, gaining momentum from our digital investments. At minds and machines, we launched Predix, and now have more than 20,000 developers. We’re expanding partnerships with important customers like Boeing, Exelon, and BP. Service growth was broad-based with power up 9%, aviation up 17%, transportation up 10%, and healthcare up 3% organically. We’re winning with new products. The H-Turbine has 67 technical selections with 21 in backlog. Power conversion revenue grew by 15% behind multiple new product launches. Our aviation engines are achieving market leadership by meeting customer commitments with superior execution. We now have 10,000 LEAP engines in backlog. Life sciences had 8% organic growth in the quarter. And we have two important wins for bioprocess manufacturing in China. We launched Current as a way to capitalize on 72% LED growth and the opportunity to build a strong presence in the C&I energy efficiency space. Margins continue to be a great GE story. Segment op margins grew 100 basis points with growth in gross margins of 80 basis points and we’ve expanded our value gap by $300 million year-to-date and expect this to continue. Our product margins are expanding, and the analytics continue to drive productivity and services. Restructuring is delivering substantial benefits and, in all, we think our margins can continue to grow. This is our tenth straight quarter of margin expansion, so we have real momentum. I would like to highlight the work of our oil and gas team as a good example of our execution. In a tough environment with organic revenue declining by 7%, they grew margins by 100 basis points organically and held earnings. This will position them well in a volatile industry. Now cash is also a good story for the year. Industrial CFOA is up 23% year-to-date. Industrial free cash flow is up 53%, and as is typical we expect a strong fourth quarter where we expect a $2 billion reduction in working capital similar to last year. The great portfolio execution mentioned by Keith will allow for upside in our cash performance. Based on accelerated progress in capital asset sales, we should be able to dividend an additional $2.5 billion to the parent in the fourth quarter, and this would be $3 billion for the year. This will put the company at the high end of our CFOA range. In an effective Synchrony execution should return about $20 billion to investors through a share exchange. And this will put us about $30 billion of cash returned to investors for the year through dividend and buyback. We still expect appliances to close in the quarter. This is not a complicated transaction. Appliances is a highly competitive industry with at least seven manufacturers and 21 brands. Electrolux wants to close and is working hard to do so. So the GE balance sheet is very strong and we will finish the year with substantial liquidity. And now over to Jeff to go through operations.\\nJeff Bornstein: Great, thanks Jeff. I’ll start with the third quarter summary. We had revenues of $31.7 billion, which were down 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues including corporate were down 2% to $25.8 billion. Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.29, up 16% year-over-year, with industrial up 9%, and the verticals up 50%. Operating EPS number of $0.32 adds in other continuing GE Capital activity including the consumer segment, headquarter run-off and other exit related items, which I’ll cover in more detail on the GE Capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.28 includes the impact of non-operating pension, and net EPS $0.25 includes the impact of discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact for the quarter was a negative $347 million, which included $1 billion of exit related non-cash charges. These charges are within the framework of $23 billion exit impact that we communicated in April. Partly offsetting the charge was income associated with operations in CLL and real estate, which will move to disc ops earlier in the year. As Jeff said, we generated $6.5 billion of CFOA year-to-date, which was down 9% driven by lower GE Capital dividends. However, industrial CFOA was $6.1 billion year-to-date, up 23%. The GE tax rate was 17%, bringing the year-to-date rate to 20%, which is in line with our current estimate for the total year rate. The GE Capital reported rate was a negative 6% in the quarter, which includes tax benefits associated with the plan to shrink GE Capital. The vertical tax rate was 0%. As we communicated previously, as we complete the GE Capital restructuring, we expect the verticals tax rate to be low double-digits. On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% on a reported basis, but up 4% organically, reflecting about 5 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was $1.2 billion drag on industrial segment revenue and $165 million impact on industrial segment op profit. Despite this headwind, industrial segment operating profit was up 5%, and organically the industrial segments were up 9%. GE Capital Vertical earnings of $351 million in the quarter were up 55%. Next I’ll go through the earnings walk. Consistent with last quarter we included a walk of the different elements of our earnings so that the dynamics are clear, given all the moving pieces with GE Capital. Starting with the first column on the left and working down, industrial operating net income was $2.6 billion and vertical income was $351 million for a total industrial plus verticals operating earnings up $2.9 billion. The GE Capital consumer segment earned $795 million during the quarter, which I’ll cover later. On the other GE Capital line, we incurred $411 million of cost, driven by exit related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter run-off, operating expenses, and excess interest. As a result, total operating earnings were $3.3 billion. Including non-operating pension costs, continuing earnings were $2.9 billion. Discontinued operations were a charge of $347 million, which I discussed on the previous page. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were $2.5 billion. In the center and far right columns, you can see the associated EPS numbers and the variance versus prior year. Next page, on one-times, we had $0.02 of charges related to ongoing industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to drive the cost competitiveness of the company. Charges were $346 million on a pre-tax basis, and $244 million after-tax. About 45% of those charges related to restructuring in our oil and gas business, as we continue to execute on our cost-out program. We had no industrial gains in the quarter. On the bottom of the page, you can see the fourth quarter estimate. We’re expecting gains from appliances signaling and embedded systems transactions in the quarter. For the year, we continue to expect gains in restructuring to be balanced on an EPS basis. We’ve increased our expected restructuring from $0.11 to about $0.14 due to the higher gains we expect for the year. We have additional attractive restructuring opportunities including Alstom, which will offset the higher gains. Now, I’ll go through each of the segments, starting with power and water. Orders in the quarters were up 8% and up 13% organically. Equipment orders were up 7% to $3.5 billion on strength in distributed power higher by 61%, renewables up 2% partly offset by thermal down 6%. Distributed power was higher driven by two fast track power deals in Indonesia and Ghana, and our first order for six LM6000 PF+ units in Thailand. The new LM6000 PF+ attains 56 combined-cycle efficiencies, which is the highest in its class. It takes half the time to install versus its predecessor and can startup to full power in about 10 minutes. Renewables orders were up 2%, up 14% excluding FX on strong international orders. Unit volumes were lower at 821 versus 839 a year ago, but megawatts were up 9%. Thermal orders were down 6%, down 2% in ex-FX. We took orders for 22 gas turbines versus 23 last year. The business booked 4 H orders in the quarter: two in Pakistan, one in Korea, and one in the U.S. This brings our total H units in backlog to 21, with an additional 47 technical ones, a seven-unit increase from the second quarter. Service orders grew 8% to $3.4 billion, driven by strength in PGS, up 10%. We continue to see success in our upgrade campaigns including AGPs, drive load, NOCs, Op Flex, all of which enhance the performance of our machines. In the quarter, we booked 22 AGPs, up four from the third quarter of last year. Revenues in the quarter were up 1%, and higher by 7% organically. Equipment revenue was down 6% driven by thermal down 10% on 16 gas turbines shipments versus 26 a year ago. And distributed power was down 30% on lower engine volume, principally driven by weak demand in the gas compression market. Renewables revenues were up 8%, and up 19% excluding exchange, on higher shipments of 735 wind turbines versus 642 last year. Service revenues were strong, up 9%, led by PGS, up 13%, driven principally by upgrade sales. AGPs totaled 22 in the quarter versus 18 a year ago. Op profit was higher by 7% and up 10% organically. Margins improved 100 basis points driven by service growth and cost productivity. As we look to the fourth quarter, no change to the framework we’ve given you on gas turbines and distributed power. Wind is turning to the low end of the range we had given you previously of 3,000 to 3,200 turbines. Next oil and gas, the business continues to perform in a very difficult environment. Orders in the quarter were down 38% and down 32% organically. All segments saw lower orders given the constrained CapEx environment and project delays. Equipment orders were down 60% with TMS down 57% driven by a large Canadian LNG push-out. Subsea was down 81% with softness in both drilling and well stream. Downstream was down 58%, surface was down 49% on lower rig counts, and M&C was down 22% on softness in flow and process technology. Service orders for the quarter were down 13%, but down 4% organically, principally driven by subsea and surface, down 26% and 39% respectively. And that was partially offset by TMS, which was up 4%, and up 20% organically on higher installations. Backlog in the third quarter ended at $22.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year. Revenues in the quarter were down 16% to $3.9 billion and down 7% organically. Foreign exchange had a $400 million impact on revenue. Equipment revenues were down 18% and down 8% organically, driven by surface down 36% and subsea lower by 12%, down 3% ex-foreign exchange. Organically, TMS was down 3%, and downstream was up 12%. Service revenues were down 14% and down 5% organic with M&C down 2%.  Op profit was lower by 12% versus last year and flat organically. Foreign exchange was a $75 million headwind in the quarter. The business continues to execute on cost and material inflation. Value gap was positive with a very modest price impact. Margins improved 70 basis points and 100 basis points excluding the effects of exchange. Through three quarters, revenues are down 13% and down 4% organically. Operating profit is down 10% reported and up 5% organically. We expect volume pressure to persist into the fourth quarter. However, given the strong execution on cost-out, we believe that for total year organic op profit will be about flat year-over-year or slightly better versus the flat to down 5% guidance we provided earlier. The team is making strong progress on achieving the $600 million of cost-out goal for 2015 and is well positioned to deliver $1 billion plus cumulatively of cost-out through 2016. In aviation, underlying travel demand continues to grow robustly, higher by 6.6% year-to-date August with strength domestically and internationally. The Middle East and Asia Pacific continue to be particularly strong. Air freight volumes grew 2.6% through August. Orders in the third quarter of $6.5 billion were down 35%. The third quarter of 2014 included large orders received at the Farnborough Air Show. Equipment orders were down 58% driven by commercial orders. Last year, we booked $3.8 billion of GE9X orders versus $600 million of GE99X orders this quarter. GEnx orders of $600 million were up three times, driven by strength in China and we had $800 million of LEAP CFM orders in the quarter. Commercial engines backlog of just under $30 billion is higher by 22% versus last year. Military orders were down significantly on non-repeat of international campaigns last year and soft U.S. demand. Services were very strong. Service orders grew 13% on strong commercial spares growth, up 28% at $39.5 million a day. Military services were higher by 76%. This was partly offset by overhaul volume being down. Revenue in the quarter was up 5% to $6 billion. Equipment revenues were down 6%, with commercial down and military down 20%. We shipped 64 GEnx units versus 65 last year, and services revenue was up 17%, with commercial spares higher by 22% and military up 16%.  Operating profit was up 7% driven by strong services volume and value gap. Margins expanded 30 basis points in the quarter. So solid quarter from the Aviation team. The LEAP testing and performance remains on track, with the first installs expected to be in service in mid-2016.  Next up is Healthcare. Orders of $4.5 billion were down 4% reported, but up 3% organically. Geographically the U.S. was down 1%; Europe was up strongly ex-foreign-exchange by 11% and down 5% reported; China was flat; and the Middle East grew 15%. In terms of product lines, Healthcare systems orders were down 7%, but up 1%, ex-foreign-exchange. In the U.S., orders were up 2%, driven by strength in CT and MR, which were higher by 10% and 15%, respectively, partially offset by weak x-ray.  The U.S. appears to have performed in line with the market. Europe was strong again, up 7% organically. That’s the fifth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth for us in Europe. The Middle East grew 22%. China was down 40% as orders continue to be impacted by lower public tenders. The private-sector orders are growing at double-digit rates in China, but off a much smaller base than the public market. Life Sciences orders grew 11% organically and 4% reported. Bioprocess grew 23% excluding FX, with very strong demand in Europe, up 42%, and in China, up 162%.  Healthcare revenues were down 5% in the quarter; up 2% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Healthcare systems was up 1% and Life Sciences grew 8%, excluding FX. Operating profit in the quarter was down 10%, and down 4% organically. Negative leverage was driven by lower value gap and higher new product spend, which more than offset the cost productivity in the business. Margins contracted 90 basis points in the quarter.  The third quarter was impacted by lower than expected volume in the growth markets and accelerated new product spend to drive future growth. The business has seen strong customer interest in productivity analytics and as a result has accelerated their migration to the Predix platform and development of productivity applications. In the fourth quarter, we expect this level of higher product investment to continue. We expect growth markets to remain challenging and developed markets to continue to show positive organic growth. In Transportation, North American carloads were down 2.2%, primarily driven by lower coal and petroleum, down about 9%. That was partly offset by 2% intermodal growth. Year-to-date rail volume is down about 1%. Orders in the quarter were down 77% or about $3 billion, as we expected, driven by locomotives.  In the third quarter of 2014, we took a 3-fold increase or about 1,100 units in orders for Tier 4. 2014 large-order intake combined with the current global commodity cycle is pressuring demand for increment of locomotive power. However, we are working on several large opportunities and expect fourth-quarter locomotive orders to be much stronger. Revenues in the quarter grew 3%, driven by services up 10%. Locomotive equipment revenues are up 11%, partially offset by mining. Operating profit was up 11% driven by volume, productivity, and deflation, more than offsetting Tier 4 ramp costs. Margins improved 160 basis points. In Energy Management, orders of $2.1 billion were up 2%, and up 8% organically, driven by strength in Renewables and our Power Conversion business, which grew orders 16%, up 26% organically. Power Conversions Renewable orders were up over 4 times on deals won in conjunction with both GE and Alstom, which offset the weak Oil & Gas Marine segment. Digital Energy orders were up 20%, and Industrial Solutions was down 13%.  Revenues in the quarter were down 2% reported, but up 6% exchange. Organically, Power Conversion was up 15%, Digital Energy was up 8%, and Industrial Solutions was flat. Operating profit was higher by more than 2 times to $127 million in the quarter. Higher earnings driven by strong cost productivity and value gap partly offset by negative FX. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter. In Appliances & Lighting, for the segment, revenues grew 8% in the quarter with Appliances up 10% on strong volume and Lighting up 5%.  The U.S. appliance industry was up 8%, with retail up 9% and contract up 7%. Lighting continued to grow LEDs. LED revenue grew 65%, partially offset by 15% decline in traditional products. LEDs now account for 39% of Lighting revenue, up from 25% a year ago. Op profit in the quarter was up 88%, driven by material deflation and cost productivity.  Next I’ll cover GE Capital. Our Vertical businesses earned $351 million this quarter; that’s up 55% from prior year, driven by transactional gains and lower annual impairments in our Aviation business, partially offset by Oil & Gas impairments in our Energy business. Portfolio quality remained stable, and GECAS finished the quarter with zero delinquencies and no AOGs. Working down the page, Consumer earned $795 million during the quarter, up 28% on gains related to portfolio exits from the international platform, partially offset by Synchrony minority interest. Our share of Synchrony earnings was $493 million. As in prior quarters, CEO Margaret Keane will hold Synchrony’s earnings call later today.  As Keith covered, we received approval from the Federal Reserve to proceed with the Synchrony separation and intend to launch the share exchange next week, subject to market conditions. GE Capital Corporate generated a $411 million loss in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit-related tax and restructuring charges, excess interest expense and headquarters operating costs. Discontinued operations ended the quarter with a $347 million loss, driven by a $1 billion noncash charge associated with the execution of our portfolio exit strategy, partially offset by operating results in the underlying businesses. These charges are in line with the $23 billion total cost construct we shared with you in April.  Overall, GE Capital reported $387 million of earnings, and we ended the quarter with $176 billion of continuing ENI, excluding liquidity. The Verticals ended the quarter with $78 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain strong, and we ended the quarter with $97 billion, including $15 billion attributable to Synchrony. As part of GE Capital’s internal reorganization, we launched a debt exchange to capitalize our international entity and to better align our assets and liabilities from a maturity and liquidity perspective.  The exchange was oversubscribed, and we accepted $36 billion of new bonds, which were price on October 5; and we’ll settle the transactions on October 26. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 13.7%, which is up 230 basis points from the second quarter. We expect to achieve 14% Tier 1 common ratio by year-end, inclusive of the additional $2.5 billion dividend that Keith mentioned previously.  Just some highlights on the right-hand side of the page. The Verticals are on track to deliver $1.5 billion of earnings in 2015. Asset sales are ahead of plan, with $126 billion signed and $60 billion closed. Once completed the Synchrony exchange will trigger the Consumer segment to move to discontinued operations. Given our significant progress, we plan to apply for SIFI de-designation in the first quarter of 2016. In the last six months, Keith and the GE Capital team have continued to deliver operationally and are well ahead of the plan on the portfolio transformation we shared with you in April.  With that, I’ll turn it back to Jeff.\\nJeff Immelt: Thanks, Jeff. Just to conclude, we have a few updates on the operating framework. We’ve kept the Industrial EPS expectations of $1.13 to $1.20. If Appliances close, we will be closer to the high end of this range; and our execution on our organic growth, margins, and corporate costs remain strong. We expect the GE Capital Verticals to be at least $0.50, with more strength in GECAS. Capital asset sales should be at least $100 billion, with more coming in the first quarter. CFOA should be about $16 billion. And free cash flows plus divestitures would be about $15 billion assuming that Appliances closes.  And we expect to return $30 billion to investors, about, reflecting the impact of Synchrony. GE is executing on its investor commitments and is on track for its 2015 goals. Our portfolio transformation is happening at an unprecedented pace. We have a focused infrastructure business with leading positions in our markets, and we’re positioned to grow faster than our competitors, with a strong dividend. We’re growing operating and gross profit margins and making Corporate smaller. We have nearly a $200 billion backlog of services that positions the Company well for any cycle, and we’re transforming GE into the world’s premier digital industrial company, in a unique position to drive outcomes for customers and grow margins.  I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge the work of the GE team. Last quarter we completed our largest Industrial acquisition, completely repositioned GE Capital, and launched one of the largest-ever IPOs. At the same time, we’re winning in the market and delivering strong financial results. I’m very proud of their work.  Now, Matt, back to you for questions.\\nMatt Cribbins: Thanks, Jeff. Lots to talk about. Let’s open the lines up for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.\\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning, guys. Is there a sense, Jeff – and either Jeff I guess. But Jeff Immelt, is there a sense with the fall-off you’ve seen in orders that there is any risk we are entering a bit of an industrial recession, particularly as it relates to growth markets?\\nJeff Immelt: So, you know, Scott, what I would say, kind of going around the world, is U.S. gets a little bit better every day. Europe is appreciably better. Meanwhile, growth markets are highly differentiated in terms of their performance and have some headwinds as it pertains to oil prices and things like that. On balance, Scott, we see as much activity as we’ve ever seen. The quoting activity, the deal activity, things like that, is still quite robust. Business for us in China is still pretty good, which is a big market. And so we still see a fair amount of opportunities out there, even amongst the volatility. So, I really believe that we can still accomplish our long-term goals in the world we see today. And then I would just remind you that we’ve got $200 billion backlog of services; it’s 70% or 80% of our earnings. It’s growing organically 8%. So we’ve got a pretty robust underpinning of the total Company as we go forward. But the quote activity is as robust today as it was six months ago or a year ago. \\nScott Davis: Okay. That’s helpful. And then it’s a little bit of a strange question, but those of us who have followed you guys for a long time have seen, I think, a higher sense of urgency or at least an execution level that’s been pretty high in the last year or so. Like you said, in the last six quarters you have beaten your margin targets or so. What do you attribute? I mean you had a big change in compensation structure that kicked in, in January. I mean, are we seeing just the benefit of past investments kind of pulling through? And how do you think about at least, how do you attribute really this higher level of execution and how GE is different today maybe than it was just three years ago?\\nJeff Immelt: So I would say, Scott, I would say again – great team. The compensation plan clearly helps. I think we made the investments three or four or five years ago that are helping us today in product lines and globalization and things like that. I mean, we don’t – we have as robust of an NPI pipeline as we’ve ever had, and we’re not dependent on any one country. We’ve got a very diversified country mix. That’s some of the stuff that John Rice had done. The last thing I would say, Scott, is look, there’s no way to describe what it feels like to run GE where the team knows exactly what it has to do over the next three years.  I mean our plan – we can’t guarantee exactly what the macro environment’s going to be. But between the GE Capital actions, buying back stock, organic growth, integrating Alstom, you’ve got a leadership team that knows precisely what we need to do for investors over the next three years. And that is a place we haven’t been in certainly since the financial crisis. That I think just helps everybody. It helps people who own the stock, and it gives the leadership team, I think, extra momentum as we go forward.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. \\nJeff Immelt: Hey, Deane. \\nDeane Dray: Hey, I had been thinking it might be too early to ask about some specifics for your Oil & Gas outlook for 2016, but you did just disclose the cost-out plan and the increase to cumulative to $1 billion there. So hopefully you can share some of your assumptions, maybe getting as granular as revenues and op profit for Oil & Gas next year.\\nJeff Immelt: So, you know, Deane, I would say in that it’s a market that is so visible and volatile, I think I’d start by reflecting a little bit on what we’ve done this year. The team I think in a very tough environment has gotten after the costs, has executed in the market, has driven services. So I think you’d say, if you reflect back on where we were in the fourth quarter last year and then where we sit today, I think our Oil & Gas team has done a fantastic job as it pertains to this year. And then I think if we look forward and just – we don’t assume that the market gets appreciably better. We would say that revenue might be down 10% to 15% next year and that operating profit might be down 10% to 15% next year, and that we hold margins in a tougher environment. And that’s – I think that’s the kind of feel that we have. And again, we still want to go through and do all of our normal fourth quarter planning on the company, but I just think it’s important to investors to have some visibility in terms of how we think about Oil & Gas and triangulating backlog and things like that.\\nDeane Dray: And just to clarify that 10% to 15%, that’s an organic number?\\nJeff Immelt: Yes, right…\\nDeane Dray: All right.\\nJeff Immelt: Yes, yes.\\nDeane Dray: Good. And then related to Oil & Gas, and you mentioned going back to the fourth quarter when oil was really still in a freefall – at the Outlook Meeting, Jeff, you said you could be opportunistic in looking at assets in Oil & Gas. And would love to hear what your thinking is today. Is there any size parameters that you can share?\\nJeff Immelt: Look, guys, we still like this industry. I would go back, Deane and – look, we never, as we built our portfolio in Oil & Gas, we never thought about it reflecting $120 for oil or anything else. Our investment is really made along the lines of – we felt like the industry was going to be growing in technical intensity, customer solutions, that over time the Oil & Gas business would look a lot like our Aviation business or our Power business or things like that, and that’s what led to the investments. So we’re a long-term player in Oil & Gas. We like the industry. We’re committed to the industry. I think as we look at opportunities and where we are today, anything would have to hurdle above buying back our own shares. And so we’ll be opportunistic, we’ll be disciplined, and we have an alternative that we think is still quite attractive for us of buying back our own shares.\\nDeane Dray: Good, that’s helpful. And just last question from me is one of the moving parts in the 2015 framework that is outside of your control is the timing, the assumption of the close of Appliances. That’s really – that’s in the hands of Electrolux; it’s in the hands of the regulators. So could you just remind us what that P&L impact would be if that close gets pushed into 2016?\\nJeff Bornstein: Yes, Deane. So you’ll recall we talked about something that looked like a $0.06 a share gain associated with Appliances. So if it got pushed out of the year, we’d probably rethink a little bit about what we’re doing on restructuring in the fourth quarter; we would consolidate a full quarter of Appliance earnings, which would be a bit of an offset. And more likely than not, that would probably entail a breakup fee. So we still think we’re well within the range of $1.13 to $1.20. But probably that would push us to the bottom end of that range versus being at the top. So we’ve thought through that, and we’ve also thought through it in terms of cash. I think we’re fine. We’re closing on Alstom and doing everything we need to do around cash flow even without closing Appliances.\\nJeff Immelt: I think, Deane, the base assumption is still that we close this deal. I think Jeff’s given you – I think it’s always good to scenario-plan; but the base assumption still is that we finish. I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t. But to your point, it’s not completely under our control.\\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.\\nSteven Winoker: Thanks and good morning.\\nJeff Immelt: Hey, Steve.\\nSteven Winoker: Hey, so since you started to talk about 2016 a little bit, I’m going to just push the envelope here. The way I’m looking at it anyways, if you hit that midpoint around $1.15 to $1.20 you talk about on 2015 EPS, it looks like $1.17, you’re telling us you’ve got $0.10 from Synchrony; you’ve got something like based on the GECC buyback, $0.06 to $0.08; you’ve got Alstom now, you’re talking about I think $0.06 minimum. So, without assuming any other growth from your Industrial business, that’s up like more than $0.20 there. Then GECC, I’m not sure what you guys are thinking for that, but we’re certainly starting to get into that well north comfortable of $1.50, especially if you could hold Oil & Gas flat. Is that – am I thinking about this in the right way?\\nJeff Immelt: Well, what I would say, certainly the pieces you’re putting together, Steve, kind of hang together, right? I would say Oil & Gas is going to be down next year; that’s got to be the working assumption. I think the focus Jeff and I are going to have is to try to offset that with lower Corporate as we think about next year; so we want to run Corporate lower. And then I would say, look, we’re going to give you guys a full estimate on all the other pieces of our Industrial outlook in December. But, look, we’ve got strong services, strong services growth, big backlogs. And we’re going to win some nice orders in the fourth quarter and I just – I feel like we’re going to look pretty good next year in the world we see today. So, Jeff, do you want to add…\\nJeff Bornstein: No, I just – I think you got it exactly right. I don’t think you can start with the premise of oil and gas flat. Having said that, Alstom is going to contribute, EPS accretion is going to contribute, no question about it, lower corporate. We expect to be better operationally in the segments, and we expect EPS is going to grow double-digits next year for sure.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.\\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. Just…\\nJeff Bornstein: Hi, Nigel.\\nNigel Coe: Hi, Jeff. I just wanted to dig into 4Q and obviously the orders primarily a function of the tough prior comp. The back – the equivalent backlog is pretty flat with where it was in 3Q. So I am wondering if you could just maybe put a finer point on organic into 4Q. You’re running at 4% year-to-date. I’m wondering how you view organic into 4Q?\\nJeff Bornstein: Well, we’ve got quite a range here on our expectation for fourth quarter orders. But generally speaking, we expect them the comp much better than what you saw in the third quarter, both headline and organically. So we’ve got some big orders in transportation, some big orders in power and water, we’re looking to deliver in the fourth quarter. We expect aviation to be slightly better. So we think sequentially the fourth quarter is going to look much better than the third quarter for sure.\\nNigel Coe: Wait, are we talking revenue orders, Nigel?\\nJeff Bornstein: Orders, Nigel. Because I think revenue in Q4 is going to look fairly comparable to what it’s been year-to-date, right.\\nNigel Coe: Yes.\\nJeff Bornstein: Yes.\\nJeff Bornstein : So we’ve been running, I think we’re at 4% organic revenue growth year-to-date. My hunch is that’s going to be pretty consistent with Q4.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Shannon OCallaghan with UBS.\\nShannon OCallaghan: Good morning guys.\\nJeff Bornstein: Hi, Shannon.\\nShannon OCallaghan: Hi, so nice to see the higher GE Capital dividend for 2015. With the Wells deal and Synchrony now done, real estate ranged, is 14% Tier 1 still the right base to be using, given that all those things that are now sort of clearly on their way out? And how are the international consumer sales, are there any things that would make you still be using 14%?\\nKeith Sherin: Shannon, this is Keith. I’d say that’s sort of the framework that we’ve agreed to with the regulatory oversight that we have, so I don’t see us changing that until we ultimately aren’t under that same framework. Right now, as you know, we ended the third quarter at 13.7%. I think with the asset sales in the fourth quarter will go up about 14%. We expect to dividend $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, based on those asset sales and our governance process. And then we’re on track for what we said we do in 2016. But I wouldn’t – I don’t see that threshold really changing until you have a different regulatory environment. That’s why it’s so important for us to continue to shrink. That’s why it’s important for us to target applying to not be a SIFI in the first quarter. I think that’s going to take some time. And then when we get done it with that, we still have our international regulators. So I think you should assume that that’s a threshold for some period of time for us, and we need to continue to exit the businesses in a rapid pace and build the capital, so that we can distribute it back to the parent.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.\\nJeff Bornstein: Hey, Julian.\\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, thanks, just a quick question on healthcare. The profits ex-currency were up in Q2. They’re down mid single-digit Q3. And you talk about R&D being hiked in the slide; so maybe just given update on the cost progress in Healthcare, particularly given the volume outlook in emerging markets and the fact that pricing is still very challenging. I think you’d talked before about Healthcare profits growing this year. I think they’ll clearly be down; but maybe give us some look in terms of the cost base entering next year.\\nJeff Immelt: So I would say, first, just to echo part of your question, I think the developed world is better, so U.S. and Europe are getting better. The emerging markets are mixed for Healthcare, but more headwind than tailwind. What Jeff said in terms of really trying to convert our Healthcare IT business, and get it on Predix, and spend a little bit of incremental R&D on that side of the business, I think it’s something that we wanted to do this year to give us some momentum going into next year. And then I think the business has a whole series of variable-cost productivity and product cost-out programs that are going this year that have yet to bear fruit that I would expect to roll into next year. So I think – look I think the markets are challenging. We did some one-time investment this year, and it’s our expectation that the team can execute better going into – the rest of 2015 and going into 2016.\\nJeff Bornstein: All right, I’d just – I’ll give you a little color on the third quarter, since you asked it. Definitely price was a challenge in the quarter. We’re down 1.9 points of price. So we had the negative $100 million of value gap. That was definitely a challenge. But the business has actually got pretty good productivity. We were well over $100 million in total cost productivity in the quarter. And really what swung here was volume was a bit lighter than we thought it was going to be, largely emerging markets. And we had about $50 million incremental spend on R&D year-over-year to accelerate the programs we talked about, and that’s where the challenge came through.\\nOperator: The next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\\nJoe Ritchie: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\\nJeff Immelt: Hey, Joe.\\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, so clearly there was an announcement recently that you guys have a new holder to your top 10 list. I was just wondering how those conversations are going and whether there are any new incremental portfolio or cost opportunities that have come from it.\\nJeff Immelt: Look, I would say, Joe, I think the white paper kind of lays out their thesis. And I think that’s – we don’t agree with everything, but it’s pretty consistent with what we’ve done and what we’re doing. And so I don’t think there would be much to add to that. I don’t know, Jeff, what would you?\\nJeff Bornstein: We are laser focused on margins and cost productivity, as we should be, reducing corporate costs. That all lines up with Trian’s white paper. And we’re about executing on orders and revenues so we can have that leverage fall through to earnings.\\nJeff Immelt: Industrial balance sheet pretty consistent with what we’ve said in the past and things like that, Joe.\\nJeff Bornstein: And that will be paced – the discussion around leverage will be paced by how quickly we get through the de-designation process in GE Capital.\\nOperator: The next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks, good morning.\\nJeff Immelt: Hey, Chris.\\nChristopher Glynn: Hey, just further to Julian’s questions on Healthcare, we’ve seen emerging markets become a much higher volume business over the past few years, and developing markets had a lot of regulatory dust settling here. So just wondering if there are any permanent evolutions or resets in the served markets there, where we, kind of, rethink what levels Healthcare performs at over the next five years?\\nJeff Bornstein: I don’t think so. Obviously, China has been a very strong growth market for Healthcare for quite a period of time. You’ve got to remember, 74% of orders and roughly revenues come from developed markets still. Even with all the emerging market growth we’ve had in Healthcare, we’re still about almost three-quarters from the U.S., Europe, Japan. So I don’t think there’s any change in the geographic footprint of where we think Healthcare is going or where the growth is going to come from. We’ve got some particular markets that are challenging based on commodities, FX, or politics; think about Russia, the Middle East. Places like Iraq are very, very tough to comp year-over-year. We actually feel a little bit better that China is stabilizing a little bit for Healthcare. The performance this quarter sequentially was better, and we think the tendering process is ultimately going to pick back up. When you think about China, the underlying fundamentals haven’t changed. There is still 1.5 billion people. They’re still building hospitals. The private market in China has grown 15% to 20% a quarter. It’s the slowdown in the public tender as part of the campaign the government’s been running there has put some slowness into what we’ve seen in terms of order. But I don’t think there’s much of a change in footprint here on a go-forward basis, and we’re still three quarters developed market driven.\\nOperator: The next question is from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.\\nRobert McCarthy: Good morning, everyone.\\nJeff Immelt: Hi, Rob.\\nRobert McCarthy: Hi, how are you doing?\\nJeff Immelt: Good.\\nRobert McCarthy: I wanted to ask a question just about if we’re heading into an industrial recession here – and you may disagree with that premise. Could you just talk a little bit about the prospect for combating deflation? Because if we’re in a deflationary environment and we have a kind of a multiyear down-cycle where we’re kind of looking for a bottom in terms of volumes and cutting price, I mean isn’t the portfolio actually set up for that, just given the installed base of equipment and the service streams you have? Maybe you could just comment on that a little bit.\\nJeff Immelt: So, Rob, again, I come back and just – U.S. a little bit better everyday. Europe stable to up; and then emerging markets volatile. Right? So I think that’s – revenue passenger miles on aviation still positive. Demand, I would say if you are in the gas and wind business and power, more positive than negative, right? Oil and gas tough for sure. U.S. market in healthcare growing better, slower in emerging markets. In other words, the first thing I would say is, the picture is a slow growth and volatility picture. And I think there is still pockets of growth out there pretty universally. And then I would say, look, the fact that we’re big installed base, recurring revenue model, margin efficient, capital efficient, I think that’s a positive for GE in this cycle. And then our value gap continues to run positive, right. So the ability of us to kind of source well on the marketplace is a tailwind, not a headwind.\\nJeff Bornstein: I would just add, the fact we have a $270 billion backlog is very, very important in that kind of environment. $200 billion of that in the service space, right? So from a price perspective, that’s quite important. We are all about product and service costs. So to maintain our profitability and grow it and, to be competitive, we have got to drive it to the same dollars of deflation that you are suggesting. So we are laser focused on this. The product and service cost competitively as just as important as the actual technology we’re selling. So we are on top of this.\\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.\\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.\\nJeff Immelt: Hey, Jeff. \\nJeffrey Sprague: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Hey, just a couple cash and liquidity related questions. First, on the Capital side, if stuff is going a little bit richer than you thought, why not upside to the $35 billion of Capital return over the program? And then just on the Industrial side, if you kind of work through the pieces, you’re kind of guiding 80% free cash flow conversion on Industrial. If we start with CFOA and take out GE Capital dividend and account for CapEx it’s kind of an 80% conversion ratio. Is there anything going on this year that kind of is conspiring negatively to that number? Should we see higher conversion into next year? Maybe you could just kind a walk us through those dynamics.\\nKeith Sherin: Hey, Jeff. This is Keith. I’ll just cover a little bit on the $35 billion. As we said, we do have a little bit of price that we’re getting, price to tangible book, so ahead of what our plan was by a bit. And that’s been offset by the fact that we’re selling faster. We tried to say that on the page by – a lot of those transactions were estimated to be later in 2016 and into 2017, and by selling them early, we’re forgoing that future income.  On the other hand, in total, we’re expecting about 1.1 times price to tangible book. We’re a little ahead. You can see the U.S. assets that we’ve sold mostly so far, are selling at 1.4 times price to tangible book. A little ahead of what we thought 1.3. And then the rest of the assets, we think if we’ve got them priced right overall will be just a little ahead of 1.1 times for the total $200 billion of sales. So I think we’re right on the $35 billion and we feel pretty good about it. \\nKeith Sherin: Yes. Excuse me. On CFOA for the year, we think our cash conversion ratio on CFOA and free cash flow for the year is going to be closer to 84%, 85%, not 80%. So we actually think we’re going to have a decent performance on CFOA. We talked to you about a goal to get to 95% over the next two to three years, we are laser focused on that. I didn’t suggest at any point in time we were going to do that in 2015. \\nMatt Cribbins: Great. Jeff, a couple quick announcements before you wrap up. The replay of today’s webcast will be available this afternoon on our website. We’re going to hold our fourth quarter earnings webcast on Friday, January 22, and we’re going to hold our annual Outlook Meeting on Wednesday, December 16. Jeff?\\nJeff Immelt: So Matt, again I think a great execution quarter for the team. I just want to particularly congratulate all our GE Capital folks for great execution on the plan we laid out on April 10. And really we’re thrilled about Synchrony, the value, the company. We think this is going to be – the Synchrony transaction, is going to be a great transaction for GE investors and for Synchrony investors. So thanks, Matt. Everybody have a good day.\\nOperator: This concludes our conference call. Thank you for your participation today. You may now disconnect.'"

       "'Executives: Louise Mehrotra – Vice President, Investor Relations Sheri McCoy - Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals Group Dominic Caruso – Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\\nAnalysts: Christine [No other identification.] Michael Weinstein – JP Morgan Chase & Co. Sara Michelmore - Cowen & Co. Rick Wise - Leerink Swann Matt Dodds – Citigroup Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs Derrick Sung – Sanford Bernstein Bob Hopkins – Bank of America Bruce Nudell – UBS Matt Miksic – Piper Jaffray Larry Biegelsen – Wells Fargo Glenn Novarro – RBC Capital Eddie Han-Burgess - Raymond James  \\nLouise Mehrotra: Good morning and welcome. I\\'m Louise Mehrotra, vice president of investor relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2010. Joining me on the podium today are Sheri McCoy, worldwide chairman of our pharmaceuticals group, and Dominic Caruso, vice president of finance and chief financial officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. The audio and visuals from this presentation are being made available to a broader audience via a webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I\\'ll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the third quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments.  Following my remarks, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the third quarter financial results and guidance for the full year of 2010. Sheri will then provide an update on our pharmaceuticals business. We will then open the floor to your questions. We will conclude our formal presentation at approximately 9:30 and following Q&A with some final remarks by Dominic, we will conclude the meeting around 10:00 a.m.   Distributed with the copy of the press release that you just received is a schedule with actual revenues for major products and/or business franchises. For the listening audience, these are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is a copy of the press release. Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this meeting may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2009 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\\'s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online. Last item. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These measures are reconciled to the GAAP measures and are available in the press release or on the Johnson & Johnson website. Now I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2010. If you refer to your copy of the press release, let\\'s begin with the schedule titled \"Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area.\" Worldwide sales to customers were $15 billion for the third quarter of 2010, down 0.7% as compared to the third quarter of 2009. On an operational basis, sales were up slightly, and currency had a negative impact of 0.8%.  In the U.S., sales declined 2.5%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 2.6%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported sales by 1.5 points. Our strongest performing region was the Asia-Pacific Africa region, which grew 4.1% on an operational basis. Europe grew 1.8% operationally, while the western hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 1.7% operationally.  If you\\'ll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings were $3.4 billion compared to $3.3 billion in the same period in 2009, an increase of 2.2%. Earnings per share were $1.23 versus $1.20 a year ago.  I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. Cost of goods sold, at 30.7% of sales, was 130 basis points higher than the same period in 2009, primarily due to the cost associated with the impact of the recalls and related remediation efforts in the consumer business and the impact of price reductions in our pharmaceuticals business and certain MD&D businesses.  Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses, at 31.4% of sales, were down 20 basis points versus last year due to cost-containment initiatives. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 11.1%, 40 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2009 due to timing of spending on projects.  Interest expense net of interest income of $95 million is $19 million less than the third quarter of 2009 with lower interest expense on lower average debt. Other income net of other expense of $292 million was $196 million greater than the same period in 2009.  Taxes were 19% in the third quarter of 2010 versus 21.2% in the third quarter of 2009. Dominic will discuss other income and taxes in his commentary. Now turning to the consolidated statement of earnings for the first nine months of 2010, consolidated sales to customers for the first nine months of 2010 were $45.9 billion, an increase of 1.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, sales were flat operationally and currency had a positive impact of 1.3 points. On the consolidated statement of year-to-date earnings, I\\'d first like to draw your attention to the boxed section. Adjusted net earnings of $10.4 billion in 2010 compares to net earnings of $10.1 billion in 2009. Adjusted earnings per share, at $3.73, were 3.3% versus the 2009 results. Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting major products or business franchises. I\\'ll begin with the consumer segment.  Worldwide consumer segment sales for the third quarter of 2010 of $3.6 billion decreased 10.6% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales declined 10.2%, while the impact of currency was negative 0.4 points.  U.S. sales were down 24.5%, while international sales were up 0.4% on an operational basis. The consumer sales growth in the quarter was impacted by the OTC recalls, currency devaluation in Venezuela, and certain divestitures. The OTC recall impacted operational growth by approximately 6 points, while the devaluation and divestitures impacted operational growth by just over 1 point each. For the third quarter of 2010, sales for the over-the-counter or OTC pharmaceuticals and nutritionals decreased 19.4% on an operational basis, compared to the same period in 2009, with U.S. sales down 40.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.5% on an operational basis. Sales were impacted by the voluntary recalls announced earlier this year and suspension of production at the McNeil Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility. As an update on the products included in the January recall that are produced at our McNeil Las Piedras, Puerto Rico facility, we are at normal levels of production. Restocking commenced in the second quarter and continues to ramp up to normal trade inventory levels for key products.  Regarding the Fort Washington facility, operations at this plant were suspended in connection with the recall of infants and children\\'s liquid OTC products manufactured there. The suspension of manufacturing also impacted adult solid OTC products manufactured at the facility.  We remain on track with our plans for ultimate supply of these products from within the Johnson & Johnson manufacturing network. We began shipping a small amount of product and beginning in the first quarter of 2011, shipments will ramp up and continue to expand throughout the year. McNeil submitted its remediation plan to the FDA on July 15. The plan applies to all manufacturing facilities McNeil operates to supply the U.S. market and addresses governance and management controls, training programs, process assessments, and process improvements. We are committed to regular and detailed communications with the FDA as we implement this plan. Now moving on to the other businesses, skincare business declined on an operational basis by 4.9%, with the U.S. down 15.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.7% on an operational basis. In the third quarter we began implementing enhancements to equipment that will continue into the fourth quarter. This has resulted in a temporary reduction of shipments for certain products.  Baby care products achieved operational growth of 3.3%, with the U.S. growing 2% and sales outside the U.S. growing 3.6% on an operational basis when compared to the third quarter of 2009. Powders and cleansers were the major contributors to the sales growth outside the U.S., while babycenter.com contributed to the growth in the U.S.  Women\\'s health declined operationally by 7.9%. Sales in the U.S. were down 14.8%, while sales outside the U.S. were down on an operational basis by 5.1% due to increased competitive pressure.  Sales in the oral care franchise were down 6.8%. In the U.S., sales were down 12.3% while sales outside the U.S. were down 2.2% operationally. Sales were impacted by the divestiture in the U.S. of the Efferdent and Effergrip brands, as well as lower sales of toothbrushes and slower category growth in mouth rinses. That completes our review of the consumer segment, and I\\'ll now review highlights for the pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide net sales for the third quarter of $5.5 billion were up 4.7% versus the same period last year, with operational growth of 5.9% and a negative impact of currency of 1.2%. Sales in the U.S. increased 6.9%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 4.6%. The third-quarter sales were negatively impacted by U.S. health care reform as well as European austerity measures estimated to be approximately $150 million.  Now reviewing the products. Contributing to the results were a number of the core products, which I\\'ll discuss in a moment, and importantly the new products recently introduced: Stelara, Simponi, Invega Sustenna, and Nucynta. With the successful launches of Stelara and Simponi, we achieved U.S. market leadership in immunology in 2010. Sales of Remicade, a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, were up 18.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2009. Sales growth in the U.S. was 4.3% due to strong market growth partially offset by lower market share in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Strong market growth and an increase in inventory levels contributed to an increase in export sales of 75.5%. The international market growth is estimated to be over 20% in the quarter. As an update on the arbitration with Merck, the evidentiary portion of the arbitration has been completed and oral argument is scheduled for late this year. It is possible we could have a decision in the first half of 2011.  Procrit and Eprex declined operationally by 22.9% during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year, with Procrit down 31.8% due to a decline in the market and the impact of the recall announced in September. Eprex sales were lower by 11.9% operationally due to increased competition and a slow-down in certain European markets. Risperdal Consta, a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, achieved third-quarter sales growth of 11% on an operational basis. Sales in the U.S. were down 16.3%; however solid growth was achieved in the combined market share of our long-acting injectables, including Invega Sustenna. Sales of Risperdal Consta outside the U.S. were up 26.6% operationally with very strong growth in Japan.  Sales of Levaquin, our anti-infective, were down 8.1% on an operational basis when compared with the same period a year ago, due to the decline in the market and increased penetration of generics. The U.S. anti-infective market is estimated to be down approximately 4% in the quarter due to a lower instance of respiratory illness and flu. Concerta, a product for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, was up 5.8% operationally in the third quarter as compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. were up 4.4% due to double-digit market growth offset by the impact of health care reform. Sales outside the U.S. were up 9.3% operationally, with strong growth seen in most major regions. Velcade is a treatment for multiple myeloma for which we have commercialization rights in Europe and the rest of the world outside the U.S. Operational sales growth was 10.1%. Timing of shipments related to tenders impacted the rate of growth in the quarter. Aciphex, as it is known in the U.S. market, and Pariet outside the U.S., is a proton-pump inhibitor or PPI, that we co-market with Eisai. On an operational basis, sales were down 5.3% with U.S. sales down 11.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 0.8% operationally. Script share in the U.S. was down 1% due to increased competition from generics in the category. Prezista, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, grew operationally 55.9% with the U.S. growing 30.8% and sales outside the U.S. growing 82.7% due to very strong momentum in share. Invega, an atypical antipsychotic, grew operationally 2.7% with gross in the U.S. of 3.3%. As an update to our pharmaceutical pipeline, during the quarter CHMP adopted a positive opinion for Invega for the treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. Additionally, in October we submitted to the FDA the pediatric supplemental NDA for Invega for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents ages 12-17 years of age. I\\'ll now review the medical devices and diagnostic segment results. Worldwide medical devices and diagnostic segment sales of $5.9 billion grew 1.9% operationally as compared to the same period in 2009. Currency had a negative impact of 0.6 points, resulting in a total sales increase of 1.3%. Sales in the U.S. were up 1.2%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 2.6%.  Now turning to the franchises, starting with Cordis. Cordis sales were down 6.6% operationally with the U.S. up 5.6% and sales outside the U.S. down 13.5% operationally. Cordis results were impacted by lower sales of Cypher, our sirolimus-eluting stent, partially offset by strong growth in our Biosense Webster business.  Cypher sales were approximately $135 million, down 36% on an operational basis versus the prior year. Sales in the U.S. of approximately $45 million were down 12%. Estimated share in the U.S. of 13% was up one point from a year ago and flat on a sequential basis. Sales outside the U.S. of approximately $90 million declined 45% operationally. The estimated market share in the quarter of 14% was down one point on a sequential basis, and down 11 points from the third quarter of 2009. Increased competition has impacted the share outside the U.S. Cypher estimated worldwide share for the quarter was 15%, flat sequentially and down 6 points from the third quarter of 2009.  Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business, achieved strong double-digit operational growth in the quarter, due to increased market share. The successful launch and the continued expansion of the installed base of Carto 3 made a strong contribution to the results. As an update on the clinical development of our Nevo stent, we submitted Nevo for CE mark at the end of the first quarter using the data from the RES-1 trial, which has demonstrated Nevo\\'s superiority to Taxus Liberte at both 6 and 12 months.  In August we began limited patient enrollment in Nevo 2. While the stent itself is performing extremely well, we have decided to suspend enrollment so that we can improve the performance of the balloon catheter. We will restart Nevo 2 once these improvements have been made.  We are currently evaluating the impact that this delay will cause in our European launch, which is subject to CE marking, and our U.S. submission, which requires data from Nevo 2. We will not launch in any market prior to the restart of Nevo 2. Moving on to our DePuy franchise. DePuy had operational growth up 2.6% when compared to the same period in 2009, with the U.S. growing 1.1% and the business outside the U.S. growing by 4.8% operationally. Pressure on pricing continued as a result of the economic trends. However, positive mix, due to continuing product innovation, has mitigated some of the impact. Operational hip growth on a worldwide basis was approximately 2%. U.S. sales declined 1% due to lower volume in the metal-on-metal bearing business and intensified pressure on price net of mix. The growth outside the U.S., at 7% operational, was driven by the success of the acetabular and cementless systems. As of the second quarter, DePuy had maintained its worldwide market share leadership position in hip. On an operational basis, worldwide knee growth was approximately 3%, with U.S. growth for the quarter at 2% and outside the U.S. growth at 4% operational.  Spine was flat on an operational basis, with the U.S. down approximately 3%, and sales outside the U.S. up 7% operationally. Pricing pressure in the category and softness in procedural volume impacted the growth in the U.S.  The diabetes franchise was up 1% operationally in the third quarter of 2010, with the U.S. business up 1.8% and the business outside the U.S. up 0.2% operationally. Macroeconomic pressures, such as increasing co-pays and out of pocket expense, continued to pressure volume growth in the category. Animus sales outside the U.S. continued to grow double digits due to continued development of the international market.  Ethicon worldwide sales grew operationally by 6%, with the U.S. up 9.3% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.4% operationally. The acquisition of Acclarent this year contributed to growth in the quarter. Growth was also driven by bio-surgicals and Mentor products, as well as increased penetration of antibacterial sutures outside the U.S.  Ethicon Endo-Surgery achieved operational growth of 3.3% in the third quarter of 2010 with the U.S. sales down 3% and sales outside the U.S. up on an operational basis by 8.4%. Growth was impacted by the divestiture of the breast care business. Excluding this impact, worldwide sales grew operationally by approximately 6%. Growth was driven by advanced sterilization, endo, harmonic, and SurgRX products.  Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics was down 0.4% in the third quarter, with the U.S. down 7.7% while sales outside the U.S. were up 9.2% on an operational basis. Growth of Vitros 5600 and 3600 was offset by lower sales in donor screening, with the move to selective testing for certain diseases. Rounding out the review of the medical devices and diagnostics segment, our vision care franchise achieved operational sales growth of 1% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. increased 1.3%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 4% on an operational basis. Growth in both astigmatism and daily lenses were driven by the strength of the underlying platforms and new product launches partially offset by lower sales of reusable lenses. That completes highlights for the medical devices and diagnostics segments, and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson\\'s third quarter of 2010. I\\'ll now turn the podium over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?\\nDominic Caruso: Thank you Louise. I\\'d like to add my own welcome to members of the investment community who have joined us here today, and also to those who are listening in via webcast and conference call. I will keep my remarks brief to allow ample time for the update on our pharmaceutical business and for your questions. I would like to provide a few comments about our third quarter results, update you on some positive developments in the quarter, and then wrap up with our guidance for the remainder of the year. In the third quarter, our business performance was solid despite a general softening in the global healthcare markets. We maintained or grew many of our market share positions. Our broad base of healthcare businesses continues to be a core strength that enables us to manage through the challenges that sometimes arise in markets where we compete. In the third quarter, we saw a deceleration of growth trends in overall healthcare spending related to the economy, which I will discuss in a few minutes.  Our third quarter reported results of $1.23 per share include approximately a $0.06 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate, resulting from changes in the mix of our business as well as favorable tax adjustments in various jurisdictions. Excluding this impact, our adjusted earnings per share still exceeded the mean of the analysts\\' estimates as published by First Call. Additionally, we had a lower level of pre-tax operating margin as compared to the prior year, due mainly to lower gross profit.  This was the result of pricing pressure across both our pharmaceutical and medical devices and diagnostics businesses as well as the impact of not shipping the OTC products from our McNeil Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility and the ongoing cost of remediation at that facility. During the third quarter we also increased our level of spending in R&D and although SG&A expenses were leveraged as part of our ongoing cost reduction efforts, these costs were not as low as you might have expected, as they also reflect some increased spending as we continue to invest in new growth platforms and product launches. These higher costs were essentially offset by an increase in other income and expense that reflects some gains from divestitures, principally from the previously announced divestiture of our breast care business. As is our practice, when we make decisions to reshape our portfolio with divestitures, we typically use any gains to make additional investments or enable other business decisions that would enhance our long-term growth. That was certainly the case in the third quarter, and we expect that a higher level of investment spending would continue into the fourth quarter. In our pharmaceutical business, we continued to see the impact from the European pricing pressures we mentioned on our second quarter call, and the impact of U.S. healthcare reform measures that were implemented earlier this year. Despite these impacts, our pharmaceutical business produced solid sales from its core products and successful new launches.  We continue to invest in the areas that we believe have significant growth potential and as you know, two weeks ago we announced an agreement to acquire Crucell. We expect that deal to close in 2011 and be dilutive to earnings per share in 2011 by approximately $0.03 to $0.05 per share. We want to make Crucell the center for vaccines in our pharmaceutical business. Sheri will be covering several positive developments in our pharmaceutical business in just a few minutes. Our medical devices and diagnostics business continued to show growth in five of seven franchises on an operational basis. In this quarter, however, that growth was tempered by a slowdown in the pace of surgical procedures, particularly in orthopedics.  This is consistent with observations that many in the analyst community have recently shared. There appear to be several factors contributing to this slowdown in the markets. We believe the effects of the weaker economy and the uncertainty that some patients face about their ability to take on additional medical expenses are prompting some patients to postpone elective procedures. One factor making this more pronounced in this quarter is the recent discontinuation of extensions for COBRA health care benefits that are available to the unemployed in the United States. However, based on the latest data that we have, we believe we have maintained or improved market share in most areas of our MD&D businesses.  In the face of this lower level of healthcare spending across the markets where we compete, our view is that in the long-term demographic trends, emerging market expansion, and advances in technology that can make a significant difference to patient outcomes will provide strong tailwinds for continued growth in the global MD&D market. We also continue to work through the DePuy/ASR hip implant recall, assisting patients and healthcare providers by providing information as well as paying for the cost for any follow up, monitoring, and treatment associated with the recall. We are still defining the extent of this program, after which we will assess the financial impact and provide you with additional information once that assessment is complete. This quarter we also completed the acquisition of Micrus Endovascular, which strengthens our neuro device business for the treatment of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.  Regarding our consumer business, the third quarter results reflect an approximately $240 million negative impact to sales and an approximately $0.05 per share negative impact to EPS from the McNeil consumer healthcare recalls and shutdown of the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility.  I am pleased to report we have begun shipping one of the McNeil children\\'s medicine products to our customers. Although they will be available only in limited quantities at first, we have been able to achieve this step by working closely with the FDA and our Canadian affiliate. Nearly 1 million bottles have been released, and we expect to distribute a total of 4 million bottles in the United States by the end of this year.  Meanwhile, in the remainder of our consumer business we saw solid results in emerging markets and continue to build on our iconic brands with new products. For example, Tylenol Precise is a new pain product launched in the third quarter which offers new insights on the science of touch and how it can relieve muscle and joint pain. And Listerine Zero, a less-intensive alcohol-free mouthwash that uses the same proven ingredients found in regular Listerine antiseptic, was launched this quarter. I\\'d like to now provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2010. Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. As you know, we raised $1.1 billion of cash through a debt offering in August. We saw a market opportunity to increase our financial flexibility with favorable terms and achieve the lowest rates on record for 10- and 30-year corporate bonds as one of the few AAA rated companies.  At the end of the third quarter, we had over $10 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $22 billion of cash and investments, and approximately $12 billion of debt. This is an improvement of nearly $3 billion in our overall net cash position from the second quarter of 2010. This past quarter we also continued our share repurchase program. To date we have purchased $9.6 billion of our stock under our $10 billion share repurchase program. We expect to complete the balance of the repurchase program by the end of this year. For purposes of your models, assuming no additional major acquisitions during 2010, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $300 million and $400 million, consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as one-time gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development [corp.] or asset sales and write-offs.  This account is difficult to forecast, but assuming no major one-time gains or losses, I would recommend that you consider modeling other income and expense for 2010 as a net gain ranging from approximately $450 million to $550 million, which is higher than our previous guidance, reflecting the recent divestiture gains. This excludes the impact of net litigation matters, which we have treated as special items, such as our settlement with Boston Scientific earlier this year. And now a word on taxes. For the first nine months of 2010 the company\\'s effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 22.2%. This does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit, because that legislation has not been enacted.  We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2010 in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance, reflecting the impact of the favorable tax adjustments we recorded in this third quarter. And while it is not yet enacted, it is our expectation that the R&D tax credit legislation will be enacted later this year and made retroactive for 2010. And as always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon the rate throughout the remainder of the year. Now turning to sales and earnings guidance, our guidance continues to be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations assuming that average currency rates for 2010 will be the same as they were for 2009. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this operational review provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also continue to provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2010 with the impact that current exchange rates could have and will use the euro as an example. Turning to sales, given the factors that we outlined earlier this year, and reflecting the impact of the lower trends in spending across many of the healthcare markets in which we compete, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting flat operational sales - that is on a constant currency basis - as compared to the prior year.  This would result in estimated sales for 2010, on a constant currency basis, of approximately $62 billion. And while we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact, if currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2010 were to stay where they were as of last week, then our sales growth rate would be positively impacted by currency for the year, due principally to the recent strengthening of the euro from $1.29 in July to nearly $1.40 as of last week. This would result in a minor positive impact on the average rate for the full year as compared to the prior year so that the expected level of reported sales would also be approximately $62 billion.  And now turning to earnings, given the lower effective tax rate that we now estimate for the year, we believe that we will be able to offset the impact on earnings from the trends we are seeing in a lower level of spending across healthcare markets and the resulting change in our estimated sales for the year that I just outlined. Also, as I noted earlier, we expect increased investment spending for the year, which would be offset by higher gains in other income.  With that as context, I suggest that you continue to consider full-year 2010 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $4.70 and $4.80 per share on an operational basis, which assumes the same average exchange rates for 2010 as we saw in 2009.  This represents an operational EPS growth rate of 2% to 4%, and while we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates for the balance of 2010 were to remain where they were as of last week, as an example with the euro nearly at $1.40, the impact of average currency movements for the year, primarily the euro, would be very minimal. And therefore, our reported EPS, excluding special items, would also be between $4.70 and $4.80 per share, an increase from our previous guidance reflecting changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We would be comfortable at the mid-point of this range. That concludes my comments on our operating performance this quarter and on our guidance with respect to your models. Now let\\'s move on to the next portion of our program today. As you know, we regularly communicate with the investment community about our long-term strategy and prospects for growth. Many of you joined us in June last year for a comprehensive review of our pharmaceuticals business, and today we\\'re going to bring you an update on the exciting progress and new developments we have made since that time. Sheri McCoy, worldwide chairman of our pharmaceuticals segment, has been leading an important transition of our pharmaceuticals business since she took that position nearly two years ago. She has helped lead that business through a period of major patent expirations and change and they have been launching important new, life-changing medicines and making important new pipeline investments to ensure we can continue to meet the needs of patients and healthcare providers. It is my pleasure to introduce my friend and colleague on our executive committee, Sheri McCoy. Sheri?\\nSheri McCoy: [Applause.] Thank you Dominic, and good morning. I\\'m delighted to provide you with an update on our pharmaceuticals business.  What I\\'m going to talk to you about today is I\\'m going to provide you with an overview, and I\\'m going to start with perspective on the pharmaceutical industry. And what you\\'ll hear is that we consider the pharmaceuticals industry a very attractive segment, recognizing it\\'s undergoing historic change. With that said, there\\'s terrific opportunity to innovate and reach patients with meaningful solutions. We will talk about our pharmaceuticals business and what I\\'ll provide you with is perspective on our business. We\\'re building momentum, driving growth, and importantly, advancing our pipeline and revitalizing our portfolio. We\\'re executing well against our strategic priorities and it\\'s really driven through our strong talent and capabilities throughout our organization. So some comments on the pharmaceutical landscape. Certainly it\\'s a very large and growing business. EvaluatePharma estimates that it\\'s a $650 billion market projected to grow between 3% and 4% over the next several years, with modest growth in the developed markets and double-digit growth in the emerging markets. The 3% to 4% is lower than what we\\'ve seen historically, and this really takes into account the pricing pressures, loss of patent exclusivity, and the various healthcare reform initiatives going on around the globe. With that said, there\\'s still tremendous opportunity with large therapeutic areas and unmet needs and opportunities to serve patients given the demographics and the change in the environment. So there\\'s an opportunity to continue to make sure that we innovate and focus on this market. Taking a look at our business, we characterize 2010 as the year of our pipeline advancement. We\\'re building momentum, revitalizing our portfolio, moving away from some of our older products to a new generation of products. We\\'re executing against our strategic priorities, focused on accelerating the growth of our launch products - those products we launched in 2009, and I\\'ll spend some time talking about those.  We\\'ll have a number of key filings the second half of this year, and we could be in a position to have five compounds in registration by the end of this year. We\\'re focused on critical geographies, and I\\'ll provide you with a brief update on some of the initiatives in these areas. And we\\'ve been focusing on our organizational effectiveness and efficiencies, both on the R&D side of our business as well as our commercial and supply chain - focusing on how we can get products to patients more rapidly. I talk about revitalizing our portfolio, and I think this chart depicts it well. If you take a look at the right-hand side of this chart, you see the red bars, and that really looks to the loss of sales due to patent exclusivity - so the Risperdals and the Topamax - as well as the impact of healthcare reform.  On the other side of the chart, what you see are the green bars. This is reflecting the growth of our new products as well as some of our key prioritized products. And if we look at the growth of those products, that represents a growth rate of 26%. So for the first nine months of this year, we\\'ve added $1.4 billion in sales, essentially offsetting the loss due to loss of patent exclusivity and healthcare reform.  Importantly, as we move forward, we want less red and a lot more green, and bigger green. So that\\'s our focus as we look to revitalize our portfolio. We have four strategic priorities, and I\\'ll walk you through each of them. In the area of innovative products, we\\'ll talk first about our launch products. We\\'re very pleased with the success of our four key launched products.  Stelara, a product for moderate to severe psoriasis with a novel mechanism of action, opportunity for three-month dosing, off to a very very good start. For the first nine months of this year our share is up 7.6 points in the dermatology market in the U.S. We also see very very strong performance in markets around the world. It has very high patient satisfaction, very good awareness with derms, particularly given the New England Journal of Medicine article, which talked to the superiority versus Ambril, and very very pleased with the performance of Stelara. Simponi is a product that we entered into the sub-cu area in immunology. What we see there is that we\\'re making good progress in terms of getting access. It\\'s a very competitive market, and one of the things we see is about 25% to 28% of the patients are biologically naive patients. What we\\'re seeing is the other 75% or so are people that have switched from either Ambril or Humira and tend to, in many cases have failed other anti-TNFs, so a more difficult patient population. We\\'re continuing to work through that. We\\'ve also just filed a structural damage claim in the area of rheumatoid arthritis and we will be filing later this year for psoriatic arthritis.  Sustenna off to, also, a very good start in the long-acting injectable arena. Good patient satisfaction and clinician satisfaction and we\\'re making progress from a formulary status perspective. This is an area where we have the opportunity to really increase the market penetration for long-acting injectibles, and that\\'s where we\\'re focusing our efforts.  Nucynta, for acute pain, we introduced the IR version in June of last year into a very competitive market with a lot of generics. We have an 8.1% share, up over three points for the past nine months. This is an area where we continue to get good progress and we\\'re making inroads both in the PCP area as well as with pain specialists. We just recently received the Nucynta ER complete response letter from the FDA. We\\'re in the process of working with them on that. There\\'s no additional clinical data that is required. It\\'s really questions about the bio-equivalence of that compound. If we now look at our robust pipeline, just a couple of words on pipeline. If we look at the market that we\\'re in today, it\\'s a changing landscape. We recognize the cost to get new drugs to market is increasing, a lot more risk. And it\\'s important that we focus our approach from a pipeline standpoint.  So we\\'ve identified five therapeutic areas. We have one individual that manages that therapeutic area and they have responsibility for end-to-end, going from discovery all the way to commercialization, looking at both large molecules and small molecules. They also have opportunity to do internal development as well as look at opportunities to build the pipeline through external partnerships or external acquisition. Importantly, these areas are also trying to understand the stakeholder insights, looking at what is going to be happening in the next five to ten years, to make sure that we\\'re building our development programs with that insight and understanding the importance of bio-markers and personalized medicine as we develop these different therapeutic areas. We also take a look at our pipeline from a total perspective to understand the risk profile, and that\\'s an area that we continue to focus on as we make investments in the various therapeutic areas. What\\'s absolutely critical for our pipeline is to have very strong scientific expertise and commercial insight, and this is an area that we continue to focus on. We have five therapeutic areas, all large, with significant unmet medical needs, and we\\'ve looked at these both from an internal development standpoint as well as an external. And just to give you some perspective as we think about this in terms of bolstering our pipeline, we have looked at external opportunities in the area of oncology.  We acquired Cougar Biotechnology for abiraterone acetate. In the area of Alzheimer\\'s disease, entered a collaboration with Elan and Pfizer to look at how we can take bapineuzumab to the market. In the area of HIV, recognizing there was a broader opportunity if we had to fix those combinations, we partnered with Gilead. And in the area of vaccines, it was really the identification of the opportunity to get into prevention, to strengthen our emerging market capabilities, and also strengthening our infectious disease, we entered into a collaboration last year with Crucell and then recently this year we just announced the intent to acquire the additional 82% of the shares in that and we hope to close that acquisition in 2011. I think this gives you a perspective on the flexibility in how we\\'re thinking about building our pipeline and whether it would be an acquisition, or a partnership, or internal development. We look at our pipeline as a very robust pipeline. We have a lot going on in the various therapeutic areas. If we take a look at line extensions in other areas to build our pipeline, what you can see is that we also have some very meaningful line extensions for our pipeline. We have a very very aggressive fourth quarter if you see the list of planned fillings, so we have a lot going on this second half of this year. Now what I\\'d like to do is spend a few minutes talking about some of the key assets. First of all, abiraterone acetate. This is a product that we acquired through the Cougar Biotechnology acquisition. It has a tremendous opportunity to make a difference for people with prostate cancer.  We have actually two clinical trials. The first was chemo-refractory patients, people who had failed chemo for the advanced metastatic prostate cancer. We had the review of interim data by an independent advisory committee. The trial was stopped because the overall survival was significant, so what we\\'re seeing is that in the case with the treatment arm with abiraterone, significant improvement in overall survival versus the placebo arm.  We are very aggressively working to file by the year end. We have a second trial for chemo-naive patients and what we\\'re planning there is potentially filing in 2012, based on an interim review by an independent panel of the overall survival data in 2012. Bapineuzumab is for the treatment of Alzheimer\\'s. Probably has the greatest potential for disease modification. It would be the first in class. This is an area that we have tremendous opportunity to make a difference for patients. If you look at the cost associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease it\\'s estimated in the U.S. to be about $150 billion. So tremendous opportunity. We have four trials underway in partnership with Pfizer. We are running the U.S. trials. We essentially have completed the enrollment in the main study and we\\'re continuing to enroll in the bio-marker sub-studies. And we anticipate filing in 2012-2013. Rivaroxaban - we\\'re very excited about this compound, has an opportunity to make a huge difference in people\\'s lives. This is an area where we\\'ve invested significantly in partnership with Bayer. We have about 60,000-plus patients enrolled in clinical studies. We\\'re focusing on five indications and I\\'ll briefly talk about the first three.  The first one is VTE prevention. This is for hip or knee replacement surgery, and we had data last year where we showed superiority versus enoxaparin. We had a complete response letter, and we are right now in the process of responding back to the FDA for the complete response and we\\'ll have that filed by year-end. VTE treatment - we have three Phase III trials underway, or in the process of either being completed or underway. We just recently announced the DVT trial where we showed non-inferiority versus standard of care, which was enoxaparin followed by vitamin K antagonist. So very good results and we\\'re in the process of completing the Einstein-PE study and we\\'ll file in 2012 once we have all Phase III trials complete. Stroke prevention is a very large trial. We have 14,000 patients enrolled. We plan to present the results of this in November - November 15 at the AHA meeting - and very excited about this opportunity and plan to file later this year. This is a double-blinded product test versus orphan, so we\\'re excited about this opportunity and again, we\\'ll hope to present the results in November at the AHA meeting. And we have two other indications for medically ill and ACS both on track. Canagliflozin is an opportunity in the area of treatment of Type II diabetes. It\\'s an SGL T2 inhibitor. We presented phase 2b data at the ADA meeting earlier this year. We have nine ongoing Phase III studies and we have over 10,000 patients enrolled at this point. And we\\'ll be planning to file in 2012, both in the U.S. and Europe. Telaprevir is a terrific opportunity in the treatment of hepatitis C. We\\'re partnering this asset with Vertex. It\\'s a potential first in class protease inhibitor. We have all Phase III studies completed at this point, all have met their primary objectives, importantly, both for treatment naive patients as well as treatment failure patients. They\\'ve all showed significantly higher SVR rate. We also had a very low rate of discontinuation and we\\'re seeing that there\\'s a significant reduction in treatment time, particularly for the naive patients. We\\'ll be filing in Europe in the end of 2010, this year. 435 is also a product in the treatment of Hepatitis C. This is one that we think is next-generation protease inhibitors that has the potential for increased patient satisfaction and potentially better adherence. We\\'ve completed three Phase II-B studies. We\\'ve got two that were enrolled for naive patients and we showed very very strong viral load reduction as well as a good safety profile and we\\'re in the process of completing the treatment failure segment of this study. TMC278 is for the treatment of HIV. This is an oral combination. It\\'s an NNRTI once-daily. We also are working with Gilead on this for a fixed-dose combination. We\\'ve had two Phase III trials with treatment-naive patients, and both trials have met study objectives, which is non-inferiority versus efavirenz, and we\\'re also seeing very strong tolerability versus efavirenz. We\\'ve filed the single agent in Europe and the U.S. in third quarter. Gilead has filed the fixed-dose combination in Europe and plans to file the fixed-dose combination in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of this year. So as we think about our portfolio, one of the things - I\\'ve talked a lot about compounds, so it\\'s really important as we look at our portfolio is to understand the pipeline from a therapeutic area perspective. So as we look at infectious disease it\\'s a matter of going from HIV - we\\'ve built it based on [Inaudible] and our understanding, broadening into 27A and then going beyond that into hepatitis C and going even more broadly into infectious disease, whether it be tuberculosis or in the area of vaccines. And so that\\'s how we\\'re thinking about our pipeline and making sure that we\\'re continuing to have the scientific capability and the commercial expertise to broaden. In the area of immunology platform, another good example where we\\'ve gone from Remicade, where we\\'ve built out indications. We\\'ve gone to new targets, as in the case of Stelara, with new mechanism of action. And continuing to look at other areas of unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases. So if you think about our pipeline, and look at it from this perspective, we go across the five different therapeutic areas, it\\'s making sure that we continue to build our capabilities in all of these individual areas. Now, talking about geographic presence. Just a couple comments. I\\'m going to focus on emerging markets and also talk briefly about Japan. Emerging markets - our key focus is on China. We\\'re focused on developing market-appropriate products, whether we do that internally or through partnerships. We\\'re also working closely with government and other key stakeholders to ensure that we\\'re working through the major healthcare reform initiatives in getting our products to patients. In the area of emerging markets, we\\'re also looking at partnerships in places like India and [inaudible], where we\\'re working with branded generic manufacturers to actually increase our local product portfolio. So we\\'re bringing in our existing global products, but also working with other partners to have local product needs - local products that address key needs. In the area of Japan, very very large market. You can see, a $128 billion market, strong growth rates. If we look at our pipeline there, we have an unprecedented number of new products in 2011. We have a very strong pipeline and we\\'re working both on our own as well as in partnership with people like Takeda, where we\\'re working in collaboration on Velcade as well as galantamine. And this just gives you a snapshot of our pipeline in Japan. One of the key points is not only are we looking at products that are specific to the market, we\\'re also in our global clinical programs as we\\'re developing new products, making sure that we have Japan in early, so we\\'re developing global clinical programs to ensure that there\\'s not a lag between our launches in the Western world and Japan. So if you look at our pipeline and think about the areas of focus, one of the key takeaways is that our pharmaceuticals business is an attractive business. We\\'re building momentum and revitalizing our portfolio, executing well against our strategies, both driving share and growth of our launched products, accelerating growth in key areas for emerging markets, and importantly spending time focused on building our pipeline. And all of this is achievable through our foundation, which is the strong people that we have throughout our organization, throughout Johnson & Johnson. Thank you. [Applause.]\\nLouise Mehrotra : So we\\'ll now begin the Q&A session. If you could wait for a mic before you ask your question because we are webcasting this meeting. So we have Catherine over here.\\nCatherine: Thanks very much. I wanted to just ask a question for next year in regards to healthcare reform impact, and I\\'m including with that the European dynamics on pricing. If you could give any kind of relative remarks versus the impact you experienced this year, and comments on the doughnut hole and what that might mean. And then on the product side, if I could ask - your nerve-growth factor program, [inaudible], have you had any interruptions to that program given what Pfizer\\'s had with Tanezumab? And then also one last question, which is on Sustenna. I\\'m wondering what your source of business is there. Are these patients patients that were on the oral Invega, and so your future for that program is pegged to what you can achieve on the oral side? Or are you seeing patients turn from the other atypicals. Thanks for your patience on those three.\\nDominic Caruso: Okay, Catherine, thanks. Let me take the first question and then I\\'ll turn over the other two to Sheri. On healthcare reform, what we\\'re seeing this year is around the same level of impact that we announced early in the year. So we said we would see somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 million to $500 million of an impact this year. It probably will be a little bit at the lower end of that as opposed to the higher end, so that\\'s good, you know, as we were trying to estimate that.  And of course not all of the provisions are implemented yet. And most of them will then be implemented next year. Consistent with what we said earlier, for 2011 the way we think about it, if I could just give you an industry perspective, remember this is about a $100 billion impact to the pharmaceutical industry over a 10-year period, but it varies by year. The impact to the industry in 2010 we estimate at about $4 billion. The impact to the industry in 2011 we estimate at $11 billion, and we expect that we will incur our relative market share percent of that.  One thing about the $11 billion, just to clarify, the $11 billion includes bout $2.5 billion that is related to the healthcare reform fee, which will not be included in sales. The industry has concluded, with the accounting experts, that it should be included in a place other than sales on the income statement, so in \"other income\" or \"sales and marketing expenses\" but in total that is the impact. And so on a sales, top line level, that $11 billion, take away the $2.5 billion, is about $8.5 billion, and that\\'s roughly around 5% of the overall U.S. market, and we would expect a similar impact in our business as everyone participating in the market will see.  Sheri?\\nSheri McCoy: I\\'ll just follow up on the two questions you had. First of all, on the anti-nerve-growth factor, we have not had any impact to our clinical study. We have been in contact with the FDA but we\\'re continuing with that and are very optimistic about that compound.  In the area of Invega Sustenna, what we\\'re seeing is the most severe patients are the ones that are being put onto Invega Sustenna. We are seeing some switching from Risperdal Consta but we\\'re also seeing people coming from other therapies where they\\'ve failed that therapy.\\nLouise Mehrotra : Mike?\\nMichael Weinstein – JP Morgan: I\\'m going to try to sneak in a couple of questions here, but I\\'ll start with Sheri. Can you give us your updated thoughts on potential competition from a generic for Concerta and whether we should be expecting one in our models for 2011? Second, related to the comments made earlier, in the commentary on DePuy there was a couple of times you talked about intensified competition [inaudible] [predominate] here - intensifying competition, intensified pressure on price, net of mix - those are the words you used. And I was hoping you could just give us a little bit more on that and tell us where is pricing in your U.S. DePuy business today for hips and knees on a year-over-year basis? And then maybe if I have time, one follow up.\\nSheri McCoy: On Concerta, at this point we don\\'t have any indication of any generic approval. As you know, we have not heard back from the FDA after our citizen\\'s petition many years ago. We\\'re still watching and waiting, but we have not seen anything additional.\\nDominic Caruso: On DePuy, the orthopedics - well, pricing in general in medical devices has been under pressure and the DePuy business or orthopedics overall our latest estimates are that price, inclusive of mix, is down about 1.5% as compared to last year.\\nMichael Weinstein: So that\\'s price offset by some benefit from mix?\\nDominic Caruso: Yeah, that\\'s the net.\\nMichael Weinstein: And Sheri, just to make clear the question I was asking on Concerta, when we get around to January - and maybe this is Dominic, you\\'re going to want to chime in here but - do you think we should be assuming in our 2011 estimates a generic competitor to Concerta?\\nDominic Caruso: I think the best way to answer that Mike, is when we give guidance in January we\\'ll let you know what we assume. [Laughter.]\\nLouise Mehrotra : Sarah?\\nSara Michelmore - Cowen & Co.: I guess just two questions on margins and it\\'s obvious to us that the pricing outlook here has diminished somewhat in the U.S., just across the businesses. Dominic, as you look out and think about strategically how you offset some of these costs, A) how are you kind of tracking this stuff and how are you guys dealing with it real time, and B) what are the potential offsets you have in terms of just dealing with this new normal in terms of price pressure?\\nDominic Caruso: One thing to clarify, in the quarter, of course, we have two impacts to gross margin, which I alluded to. One is pricing pressure, and the second is the lack of sales of the OTC business compared to prior year -\\nSara Michelmore -: And that was actually the second part of my question, not to interrupt, but when does that get back to some sort of normalized level? What\\'s the shipment?\\nDominic Caruso: Okay. So with respect to pricing overall, both in medical devices both in U.S. and Europe, and in healthcare reform impacting price essentially in pharmaceuticals, we had talked about the fact that we were beginning and are now implementing an enterprise-wide supply chain initiative. That will help us in terms of being able to control better the price of production, the cost of production, and therefore try to mitigate any of the pricing impacts that impact gross margin. So that program is underway.  Of course, it\\'s not a one-year program. It takes time, it involves rationalization of plans, and efficiencies in the production arena. We believe that\\'s a good place to go in the business. We think we have opportunities there. We would rather not reduce our investment in R&D spending and we\\'d rather not cut back on the investment necessary to launch the products successfully in the market. So that\\'s how we\\'re addressing gross margin through the operations initiative.  In terms of the supply of the McNeil products and the ramp-up of the Fort Washington plant, the plant is shut down as you know. The plant will not be operational until late 2011. However, we\\'ve already begun transferring the products to other manufacturing locations within Johnson & Johnson as I stated earlier.  We began shipping already some products at a smaller, limited quantity. It will ramp up again through the end of the year and then throughout 2011. In the first half of the year we\\'ll ramp up to normal levels. It probably won\\'t reach normal levels until mid-way through the year.\\nSara Michelmore -: And just a quick followup on the diabetes business. Louise, it just seems like the trends are really tough there and I\\'m surprised that it\\'s bad internationally as well, excluding Animas. What\\'s going on in that business? Is it pricing? Is it volume? Can you give the full detail? Thanks.\\nLouise Mehrotra : So we are seeing some volume reduction in it because of increasing co-pays as well as out-of-pocket expenses, so we are seeing volumes being depressed.\\nDominic Caruso: I think that\\'s true. I think pricing also has been an impact in that business as well, but Louise is right. Overall, out-of-pocket spending by consumers is under pressure, and that particular business, of course with diabetes test strips there is some out-of-pocket spending that impacts consumers\\' behavior.\\nLouise Mehrotra : Rick?\\nRick Wise- Leerink Swann: First a question for Dominic and then a couple for Sheri. Dominic, obviously you touched on the U.S. procedure - volume still down - you talked about the economy and out of COBRA and everything - to the extent that you can specific to ortho or Ethicon, did you see any improvement in the quarter? Have you seen any stabilization or improvement? I\\'m talking about ex of price now, just any kind of procedure rebound or stabilization in September, October versus the fall off the cliff in June?\\nDominic Caruso: Well, we don\\'t have great data yet for September or October. Procedures did slow down across the board. We do think it\\'s as I said earlier, this manifestation of all of a sudden in the U.S. those who are unemployed and had the extension of COBRA benefits. And many of you may remember this. There\\'s a 65% subsidy to individuals that were unemployed to help them cover their COBRA costs, and that went away in May. So obviously that had an impact in individuals deciding whether or not to go in for elective procedures. We did see a slowdown overall in hospital admissions and also in elective procedures and in overall lab tests, and [inaudible] was also a slowdown. Aesthetic medicine seems to be recovering, which is an unusual phenomenon I guess given everything else that we\\'re seeing, and overall we do believe that this is a factor that\\'s absolutely tied to unemployment, and I think it was broad-based in what we saw. Louise, I don\\'t know if you had any other observations in the data.\\nLouise Mehrotra : No, I think that pretty much covers it. Future volumes in the U.S. are flat.\\nRick Wise: And now for Sheri, just a couple of specific points, Sheri. I really wish you\\'d tell us what you think about the Merck litigation [laughter] but let me try to ask you a question that you will answer. In the event that J&J would win full rights to Remicade from Merck, if that would happen, what\\'s your ability to ramp production? How quickly, and what kind of investment? Are there incremental regulatory steps you\\'d have to take? Basically, how quickly could you make all that happen?\\nSheri McCoy: We\\'re prepared. [Laughter.]\\nRick Wise: Okay. I\\'ll take that as a sign of optimism. And then turning to the ROCKET-AF trial, just curious your press release strategy there if you wouldn\\'t mind. Will there be a press release via either J&J or Bayer before, or are they embargoed, do we have to wait for the release at AHA. Can you release any top line data stating what you achieved, the primary end points, etc.?\\nSheri McCoy: We\\'re in discussion right now with Bayer on that point, because obviously it\\'s material for them. So we\\'re in discussions with them on what we can and cannot release.\\nLouise Mehrotra : Matt?\\nMatt Dodds – Citigroup: So Sheri, for you, on the drugs today it looks like Procrit, Aciphex, and Levaquin are the three that are either seeing share pressure, price pressure. Is it your take those are the primary three and that if you look at the rest of the portfolio it\\'s in decent shape on those front? Or is there any other drugs we should be thinking about that could fall under that category?\\nSheri McCoy: We feel very good. If you looked at those growth products that I identified, the 26% growth, a lot of that, you know the Prezistas, the Concertas, etc. are doing very well. So you\\'re right that Levaquin is one that will be coming off patent in 2011. We\\'re seeing some decline there and some generic impact, but we feel very good about the products and are investing - if we have a choice from a marketing and sales spend we\\'re investing behind the growth products. And so those are areas that we\\'re not focusing on. Aciphex we continue to invest behind as well, but we do see some challenges in that space, PPI space\\nMatt Dodds: And on that point, I would assume some of these drugs still have the potential for price, at least in the U.S. Not these, but some of the other drugs that are doing better.\\nSheri McCoy: Obviously we always look at pricing and what\\'s appropriate relative to the market dynamics.\\nMatt Dodds: And then Dominic, one for you. When you talk about the gross margin, and I don\\'t want any specifics for next year, but right now pricing\\'s impacting it, but I also wonder with the lower volumes you\\'ve been running, you\\'ve probably been running because the trends have been lower. Is it possible we\\'ll see an impact due to higher overhead allocation as that inventory starts showing up, whether it\\'s fourth quarter or next year? Or do you have the efficiencies to offset the lower volumes you\\'re probably running in some of these plants. And that\\'s not consumer, that\\'s MD&D and non-McNeil consumer.\\nDominic Caruso: Right. Well, as I said earlier this enterprise supply chain initiative that we\\'ve embarked on will help us address that issue and we\\'ll do everything we can to keep margins reasonable in the face of these pretty severe pricing pressures. But this is not a one-year project, right? This takes some time to get the plants rationalized and volumes moved around in the right place. So we\\'ll do our best. We don\\'t manage each line of the P&L that way, Matt. We look at overall - what\\'s the overall performance of the business and what\\'s the best place to invest versus reduce costs. So we\\'ll do what we can with the gross margin line, but it\\'s not a one-year project.\\nMatt Dodds: Is it logical at these lower volume rates you\\'re probably running that there will be some impact from that?\\nDominic Caruso: We would expect volumes to go up, of course, as sales grow, so -\\nMatt Dodds: No, I\\'m saying for what you\\'re running now.\\nDominic Caruso: What we\\'re running now? Sure, there\\'s volume pressure in overall gross margin. That\\'s reflected in the overall gross margin. That\\'s correct.\\nLouise Mehrotra : Jami?\\nJami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: Dominic, can you bring us up to date on your latest thinking on the company\\'s M&A strategy? It just seems from some of the recent deals you\\'ve done, Cougar, Elan, Crucell, that your risk appetite has grown. In the case of Cougar it\\'s paid off, congratulations. In the case of Elan you\\'re buying an asset for a lot of money before the key critical data is released. Crucell seems like a lot of money to pay - a billion more than what Wyeth\\'s offered just a little over a year ago. So I\\'m wondering if you could, again, refresh us on your M&A strategy. Has your risk appetite grown?  And secondly, your cash position. Like many large healthcare/pharma companies, most of your cash is growing overseas relative to the U.S., and I\\'m just wondering if you could share your thoughts on how you\\'re going to put that cash to work given the requirements to repatriate to the U.S.\\nDominic Caruso: Right, well just an overall comment on the M&A strategy. Of course it\\'s part of a growth strategy, which begins with investing in organic development first and foremost. It is the most capital efficient way for us to grow. Then Jami, as you know, we partner and license products quite a bit, so there\\'s a second-tier strategy, partnering and licensing. And then thirdly, selectively acquiring companies and assets where we think the returns are appropriate given the risk profile.  So I\\'m not sure the risk appetite changes as much as we learn more about the relative compounds we\\'re able to better assess the outlook for those compounds and therefore hopefully work a deal where the price we pay gives our shareholders an appropriate return given the risk of putting shareholders\\' capital to work. So in the case of [inaudible], obviously we worked closely with that team in our due diligence efforts and we\\'re pleased with what we saw, which enabled us to go forward. And with Crucell, as Sheri mentioned, we already had a collaboration with Crucell last year, obviously learned a lot about the great capabilities that that organization has. So we\\'re able to better assess the risk involved and therefore take the actions that we took.  And then second part of your question about utilization of cash and many companies in our industry in particular have cash overseas and as you know greater than 50% of our business is overseas, so it\\'s natural that we would accumulate some cash overseas. We\\'ll intend to invest that appropriately. Crucell is a good example of that. We\\'re going to use our ex-U.S. cash to invest in the Crucell transaction and we\\'ll always look for opportunities to use that cash. But having a little bit of cash is not such a bad thing these days.\\nLouise Mehrotra : Derrick?\\nDerrick Sung – Sanford Bernstein: I wanted to go back to the pricing pressures and environment that we\\'re seeing in Europe. I was wondering if you could give us, either Sheri or Dominic, some details first on what you\\'re seeing now in terms of the austerity measures, and I think you quantified $150 million in pricing pressure. Where is that coming from? Which specific countries? Are there specific categories that are being impact? And then how do you foresee that playing out next year? Is that going to spread to other countries, or is it going to be the same countries that are having those today? And then just a follow on to that, if you could comment on the medical device environment in Europe as well, and with budgets rolling around what do you expect to see next year in terms of budgets and pricing from Europe there?\\nLouise Mehrotra : Derrick, can I just clarify one thing, the $150 million includes U.S. healthcare reform as well as European austerity measures. It\\'s about two-thirds U.S. healthcare reform, one-third austerity measures.\\nDominic Caruso: And just to further clarify that $150 million Louise was talking about was in the quarter, so $100 million of U.S. healthcare reform and $50 million of European austerity. We have previously discussed in the previous quarter review that we expected the impact of European pricing pressure for 2010 to be about $200 million, and that we didn\\'t see much of it early in the year. We saw it ramping up through the latter part of the year. We are seeing what we expected we would see, so our estimate was about $200 million for this year.  Obviously since it\\'s just ramped up towards the latter part of this year we would expect that this would continue into next year. The pricing pressures appear to be somewhere in the neighborhood of mid-single-digits in terms of incremental price in the European markets that we compete in. So that\\'s what this $200 million refers to for the second half of the year, and obviously you can consider what the full-year impact might be in 2011. It\\'s not any particular country, per se. It\\'s all the countries that have announced various austerity measures. That\\'s our estimate of how those will roll into next year. So we can\\'t single out any one particular country.  And then in medical devices, we haven\\'t seen much of a pricing impact per se in the European market, but rather a slowdown in volume, or a procedure slowdown.\\nLouise Mehrotra : Bob?\\nBob Hopkins – Bank of America: I just wanted to see if I could get you to clarify the comment earlier about orthopedic pricing trends, that down 1.5%, which is a net of price and mix. First of all, is that a global number for global hips and knees? And how does that compare to what you saw the last couple of quarters, where I think you\\'ve commented at [inaudible] like these that there had been no change. Now I think you\\'re saying maybe there is a little change. Just wanted to get a sense for what that is sequentially.\\nLouise Mehrotra : So hips and knees, together in the U.S., is down about 1% to 2%. That\\'s pretty consistent in total versus the prior quarter. OUS is down about 1%. And then spine is - previously I had said it was down mid-single digits. We did see, actually, some positive on the spine pricing, so it\\'s still down, but it\\'s down less than the last quarter.\\nBob Hopkins: So did anything get worse sequentially, hips, knees, spine from a pricing perspective?\\nLouise Mehrotra : In total if you look at hips and knees together it\\'s similar, but we did see a little bit more in the hip in the quarter versus the knees in the U.S.\\nBob Hopkins: Okay, so if there\\'s any change sequentially it was really just spine getting a little better.\\nLouise Mehrotra : Spine got a little better, and we did see hips get a little tougher, but we saw knees offset that. So in total we\\'re very similar.\\nBob Hopkins: And then two other really quick ones. I was wondering if you could talk to volume, specifically to the general surgery business as [inaudible]. You made comments broadly about medical devices, but I was wondering if there was anything from the divisional level that was mentioned on procedure volume in Ethicon or Ethicon Endo, particularly. And then finally, on gross margins, I was wondering, can you quantify the impact specifically of the recall and remediation on gross margin this quarter?\\nDominic Caruso: On the first question, with respect to procedural volumes, we did see overall hospital admission rates go down and elective procedure volumes slow down in the quarter. That was present in both the Ethicon and Ethicon Endo businesses. As Louise mentioned, the Ethicon business had about a significant impact in the U.S. from the acquisition of Acclarent, and without that business it grew at lower rates than we\\'ve seen in prior quarters. And the same with Endo, a little bit different situation there. That was impacted by the divestiture of the breast care business, but without that divestiture the growth rate was still below the rates which we\\'ve seen in prior quarters. So it\\'s pretty clear that surgical procedures as evidenced by hospital admissions, etc. have declined in the quarter and we\\'re one of the first companies that report, as you know Bob, so we\\'ll have to see what others report in this regard.  And the second part of your question was what?\\nBob Hopkins: Just on the gross margin, if you could quantify the impact of the recall and remediation on gross margin this particular quarter? You mentioned a bunch of things impacting, including price, and I was wondering if you could -\\nDominic Caruso: I\\'d rather not get that specific on the specific cost of the remediation.\\nLouise Mehrotra : Bruce?\\nBruce Nudell – UBS: Question for Sheri and then for Dominic. Sheri, could you scale what you think the U.S. market opportunity is for novel anticoagulants and given the profile of Xarelto to date, which is kind of superior efficacy, comparable bleeding. Is there a sweet spot in secondary prevention for VTE or high-risk AF patients? And for Dominic, we\\'ve come to the conclusion that the step up in pricing pressures is ascribable to the profit squeeze that hospitals are experiencing. Declining elective procedures worsens that. Looking forward, when things get better, which they hopefully will, will things get better on the pricing front? Or have hospitals found religion and have there been secular changes that just make it a really tough environment going forward?\\nSheri McCoy: On the U.S. thrombosis market, if you look at the size of the market today it\\'s about a $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion market, projected to grow to about an $8 billion market. Importantly, if you look at people who are using warfarin or Coumadin today the issue is around monitoring and what we see is if you have an oral anticoagulant we think there\\'s an opportunity not only to reach those patients but potentially to even grow the market, because it\\'s much more convenient. People will stay on the medications, etc. And in the studies that we\\'re doing, obviously we haven\\'t seen the data yet on the a-fib, but we will see that in the next few weeks and be able to present that. Certainly we think that will be an opportunity, because we\\'ll be testing versus standard of care, which is warfarin. So we believe that there will be broad usage and penetration based on those results, assuming a very positive result. [Inaudible question.] I think there is. I think that it is going to be an oral factor 10A. It will be different than [inaudible] and we think that it will depend on the data that we get, but assuming very positive data we think there will be a sweet spot.\\nDominic Caruso: Bruce, you\\'re absolutely right that hospitals are under some profit pressure, and you also mentioned that elective procedures slowing down compound that, but we think they\\'re obviously related. One of the reasons why they\\'re under some profit pressure is there are less volumes in the hospitals, and many of the volumes are down because of this uncertainty in terms of can someone who\\'s unemployed afford, or should they incur the out-of-pocket cost. I think obviously as that improves volumes would improve and elective procedures would improve and hospitals would be under less pressure. Whether or not price returns to where it was before, I don\\'t want to speculate now. I think it\\'s too early to speculate. But I do think that these two phenomena are related. The profit pressure of hospitals is primarily related to the volume pressures that they\\'re facing today.\\nLouise Mehrotra : Matt?\\nMatt Miksic – Piper Jaffray: Dominic, one follow up for you on the P&L. Earlier in the year you started creating some flexibility to help push behind these new product launches. We\\'ve seen some underperformance in some of the med device markets and consumer markets. Just wondering is this forcing you to prioritize, push some things into 2011. What are some of those things if that\\'s true?\\nDominic Caruso: As I said in my comments, we did see some pressure on gross margin as you can see from the results, but we decided that it was important for us to continue to invest in R&D in particular, so you\\'ll see R&D went up a little bit as a percent of sales and SG&A not as far down as you might have expected, because we\\'re going to launch these products successfully. We\\'re fortunate enough to be able to have some other offsetting gains when we readjust our portfolio and divest some assets as you\\'d expect us to. We\\'d redeploy those gains to other pieces of the business. So we\\'re going to continue to invest in the business, and I\\'ve tried to highlight for you how we intend to cover that in the current estimate.\\nMatt Miksic: One question on just what you\\'re seeing in terms of hospitals. We\\'ve talked about how patients are acting, we\\'ve talked about pricing. In terms of some of the businesses you have with exposure to capital and equipment, either in diagnostics or elsewhere, maybe in cardio, what are you seeing hospitals do in terms of investing in their own facilities? How do you expect that to continue?\\nDominic Caruso: Well, we don\\'t have a significant part of our business that is impacted by capital purchases, but in both diagnostics and in some of the Biosense Webster business obviously we do see hospital pressure in terms of capital budgets. Although the launches of the OCD products are doing well, the Vitros launches, and as Louise mentioned the Carto system in Biosense Webster seems to be doing well. So where there\\'s innovation and improvements in the throughput of a hospital, we see less pressure on capital spending there.\\nMatt Miksic: And just one last one on some color around DePuy if you wouldn\\'t mind for [trauma] and Mitek. If you could give us some color on U.S., OUS growth it would be helpful.\\nSheri McCoy: Sure. So operational growth on trauma was 1% in the U.S. and minus 3% OUS, so total is flat. And Mitek, about 11% in the U.S., OUS about 3%. In total it\\'s about 7%.\\nLouise Mehrotra: Larry?\\nLarry Biegelsen – Wells Fargo: First, for Sheri, can you talk about the 5.9% operational growth we saw in pharma? Very strong, just the sustainability of that? And then for Dominic, the med tech market, you presented in June, I think, 5% K growth through 2014. What do you think the market\\'s growing at right now? How do recent trends affect that K [growth]. What kind of lag do you think there\\'s going to be between unemployment and a rebound that you talked about earlier?\\nSheri McCoy: As we talked about revitalizing our portfolio our focus has been on driving those growth products. What we saw in third quarter was strong growth from those key products. We did have some benefit of some one-time differences, specifically the Remicade international shipments and some year-on-year comparisons in our oral contraceptive business. So we do expect to continue to grow, but I think we did see a specific benefit in third quarter based on those one-time items.\\nDominic Caruso: Larry, you\\'re right. In the June MD&D review we estimated that the MD&D market through 2014 would grow at about 5%. It\\'s obviously not growing at that level now. We do think that that phenomenon we saw in the U.S. of the termination of these COBRA benefits has a significant impact in patients deciding whether to go in for these elective procedures. So I\\'m not sure that that\\'s a long-term phenomenon. It\\'s hard to say, but I would say that the 5% over time might be under a little pressure if unemployment stays at these relatively high rates for an extended period of time. I can\\'t give you a new estimate as of now.\\nLouise Mehrotra : Glenn?\\nGlenn Novarro – RBC Capital: Two questions for Dominic. One, on pricing in Europe, I\\'m surprised you said pricing was pretty flat in Europe for medical devices, but I guess that\\'s mainly because Europe\\'s a tender system and a contract-based system and most of the contracts in place were started at the beginning of the year. But we are in a period now where tenders and contracts are going to start getting re-upped and all our research tells us that pricing\\'s going to get worse in Europe next year. So I\\'m just wondering, have you checked in with a lot of your divisions recently? Do you have any feel for how contracts and tenders are coming up in the most recent period in the last month or so? And what should we assume for pricing in Europe next year? And then just on the share repurchase, you picked up the share repurchase you said. Is that because of the debt financing or is there another reason why all of a sudden you\\'re starting to pick up the repurchase again?\\nDominic Caruso: I think you\\'re right that we will see some pricing pressure in medical devices in Europe in 2011 and we certainly didn\\'t see much of it so far in 2010. The other phenomenon in addition to the tender system is of course many of the countries have a DRG system, so there\\'s not a direct specific price for the product issue as there is in pharmaceuticals, where governments pay the hospitals a fixed cost for the procedure. So that tends to buffer the pricing impact a little bit in medical devices. But I do think as tenders - and our folks have told us that as tenders are coming up they\\'re sensing some pricing pressure will manifest itself in 2011, but I can\\'t give you an estimate as of now. We increased our share repurchase program for a couple of reasons. It has nothing to do with the debt financing. That was just opportunistic that we were able to get long-term debt at extremely attractive rates. We typically look at the overall cash utilization of the company and when we\\'re evaluating various opportunities in the business we may pause and take a look at other things. So as you know we completed Micrus. We have now announced the acquisition of Crucell. Unfortunately our stock did take a bit of a hit early in the quarter at what we thought was an unusually low level. So I think, you know, alignment of where we\\'re spending our cash and also that short period of time that we saw the stock take a hit we took advantage of that opportunity.\\nLouise Mehrotra : And Glenn, I just want to clarify a little bit. The pricing in Europe in medical devices, we always have pricing pressure in that market. What Dominic was referring to was additional because of European austerity. We\\'ve seen very limited impact because of European austerity. And we\\'ll take one last question from Eddie.\\nEddie Han-Burgess - Raymond James : Dominic, one question for you and a set for Sheri. Dominic, you indicated twice that the SG&A leverage in the quarter was tracking below what the Street expects. When would the pronounced leverage show up? And Sheri, I\\'m surprised to see that Yondellis is still on, given the complete response letter last year about this time - data were less than compelling. What is the future of Yondellis? Can you elaborate on the FDA\\'s response letter on Nucynta ER. How big of a push out does it entail, and the commercial strategy. Are you waiting for the ER approval to fully commercialize IR?\\nDominic Caruso: On the SG&A line, and as you\\'ve heard us say before, we don\\'t typically manage every single line in a certain formula base. We decide to invest where we think it\\'s appropriate to invest. Remember that we\\'ve implemented a restructuring program, which was partially implemented this year and then expands in 2011. So obviously that will have some impact on the SG&A line. But as I said earlier, and as we said when we announced the restructuring program, that we\\'ll look to reinvest as much of the savings as we can when launching new products. So as these products that Sheri\\'s business and Alex\\'s business are beginning to come out of the FDA and into the marketplace we\\'re going to take every opportunity to invest behind them. I think you\\'ll see us manage the overall P&L and not necessarily just one line of the P&L. So I can\\'t comment on exactly what will happen to that line in the long-term. But you\\'ve seen us manage on an overall pre-tax operating margin and when we don\\'t we try to describe exactly what we\\'re doing instead of improving pre-tax operating margins. But I think in this marketplace, with slower markets in particular, I think it\\'s wise to continue to invest in the business and not retract from the markets, because we still see great opportunities in these markets and we want to be there once the markets return.\\nSheri McCoy: On Yondellis, we\\'re optimistic about that product. We received a complete response because they wanted to see overall survival data. And so we\\'re continuing the study to - and it\\'s based on number of events, but we do have that product approved in many markets around the world, so we\\'re optimistic on Yondellis and certainly we\\'ll focus on getting the overall survival data to go back with a complete response letter. For Nucynta ER, the question from the FDA was around bioequivalence of what we did the safety and clinical testing on relative to another formulation that we\\'re planning to launch from a tamper-resistance perspective. We will be in discussions with the FDA and we\\'ll get more clarity around what\\'s required for this bioequivalence. I think the important thing is that they\\'re not asking for additional clinical data. As it relates to Nucynta IR we have been aggressively selling that product. We are focused on primary care physicians as well as pain specialists and orthopedics, and so we are not doing anything to slow down IR in waiting for ER.\\nDominic Caruso: Okay, well thanks. Thanks everyone and thank you Sheri for a terrific review of the pharmaceutical pipeline. In closing let me just say we remain positive about the underlying growth opportunities for our business as our new products, robust pipelines, and core businesses position us well for continued growth. Going forward, we see the global economy recovering, albeit slowly, and we continue to invest in some of the fastest growing segments of the healthcare industry as the economy recovers. We are confident we will continue to manage our businesses effectively based on our broad base in healthcare, our financial discipline, and most importantly thanks to the dedication, focus, and integrity of the people of Johnson & Johnson. I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress and seeing you in January along with our chairman, Bill Weldon, when we discuss our fourth quarter and year end results and provide guidance for 2011. Thanks for your time this morning, and have a wonderful day. '"

      "Denise L. Ramos: Well, let me just thank everyone for joining us on the call today. You can tell, we're very excited about this company and the prospects that we have. In the Q2 results, you see the strength that we have because of the diversified portfolio. You see the attractive end markets that we participate in. And then you also see the strong execution that this whole team is driving in all of our activities and in all of our facilities and taking as much optimization as we can in our structure to eliminate costs and lean out our facilities. So we're laser focused on that. We are mindful of the global economic uncertainty, and we will continue to be mindful of that, watch it, monitor it, and we will take the appropriate actions. So we look forward to talking with you again in a quarter from now. So thank you again.\n",

      "s. So that’s number one. Secondly, is I understand the issue about longevity of the Board members. I think unfortunately or fortunately we’re in a position now what we need to add we can’t rotate to and I think that adding too many Board members at once is a risk as well just the culture in the thinking of the organization. So A it’s not my ultimate decision. I can make a recommendation to the Board. And right now my recommendation to the Board we need to add somebody and we need to add one or two people with a different perspective than as the previous one. The previous caller suggested financial expertise and our real estate expertise and bringing some of the financial or retail expertise. So ultimately I’m sure at some point there will be a rotation right now I’m more focused on the additions and bringing in a different perspective. End of Q&A\n",
