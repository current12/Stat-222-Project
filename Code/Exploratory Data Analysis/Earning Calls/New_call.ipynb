      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Today we reported revenue of $664.2 million, and a GAAP net loss of $0.37. This included a one-time tender offer to purchase employee stock options that were significantly under water. On a non-GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $0.09 per share. Revenues grew 38% over the previous quarter as we gain market share in both channel sell-out and OEM inventory replenishment increased.  During the quarter, we made good progress managing operating expenses and reducing inventory. We have ongoing initiatives to reduce operating expenses further while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives, which are: one, maintaining our GPU leadership; two, driving the GPU computing revolution; three, increasing the adoption of GPUs in all segments of computing; and four, leading the mobile computing revolution.  Our discrete desktop GPU share increased again this quarter. In the discrete desktop GPU segment, we gained 6% to 69%.  Our notebook and desktop GPU share are about the same and the desktop GPU has exceeded our previous record levels achieved during Q1 of 2008. In addition to graphics leadership, our strategy is to lead the industry to the next level with physics processing. With our physics engine and library, which is available for PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and the iPhone, game developers can create amazing environments using physics simulations that are dynamic, realistic, and interactive with the player.  PhsyX has been adopted by EA, THQ, 2K Games, and most recently, Sega. We have built up a rich pipeline of exciting games with PhsyX support. Mirror’s Edge and Sacred 2 have shipped and received rave reviews, and we anticipate the release of Terminator Salvation, Dark Void, Darkest of Days, You Wars, and Cryostasis -- each of these titles, when run over the 100 million NVIDIA CUDA GPUs in the market will experience a dramatic speed-up. Physics processing is extremely taxing even for the highest-end CPUs. By offloading the processing to CUDA, the parallel computing mode of our GPUs, we can speed up physics processing by an astonishing five to 20 times. And it’s clear now that physics processing is becoming a must-have technology, just as programmable shading has been the last five years.  Utilizing the GPU for parallel computing is one of our most important strategic initiatives. We invented CUDA to harness the massive computational resources in a GPU that is otherwise used only for 3D graphics. The adoption of CUDA is global and GPU computing has reached the tipping point.  GPU computing will be incorporated into the two most important operating systems in the very near future -- Windows 7 with DX compute, and OS 10 Snow Leopard with Open CL will incorporate GPU computing into the core operating system and the GPU will become indispensable to achieve a great computing experience. This quarter we released our first Open CL drivers to developers who participated in our open CL early access program and demonstrated DirectX compute on Windows 7 at the Game Developers Conference.  There’s a growing lists of consumer applications that are accelerated by CUDA. I spoke about physics processing that will be in nearly every game. This quarter, motion DSP [D-Reveal], ArtSoft’s SIM HD, Cyberlink’s Espresso, Nero Move It, and Super [Loylascope] announced support for CUDA.  CUDA has opened up the high performance computing market to our GPUs. We server this multi-billion dollar new growth market with a product line called TESLA. This is a greenfield market for us and our three-year effort has given us a significant lead to the competition. We have traction in virtually every major high performance computing category from finance to oil and gas to medical imaging, to super computing centers. We have significant projects throughout the U.S., Asia, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Europe, Eastern Europe, and India. Success stories are surfacing from all over the world. This quarter in China, Geostar is performing the search for oil and gas using TESLA. Working with the Institute of Geology and Geophysics as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Geostar has demonstrated its solution of running 600 times faster than what was previously possible with a CPU-based cluster.  French banking giant BNP Paribas Corporate and investment banking division recently replaced 500 CPU cores with just eight TESLA GPUs. They sped up response times by 15X while consuming less than one-tenth the power. BNP Paribas effectively reduced the energy consumption of performing the same calculation by nearly 200 times. Increasing computation throughput while reducing cost and energy consumption has become a mission critical imperative for nearly every company.  We announced this week the TESLA GPU pre-configured cluster, which increases the accessibility of super-computing clusters to the millions of engineers, scientists and researchers around the world. The TESLA pre-configured cluster is a ready-to-install super-computer that is available from a network of certified TESLA vars including [Cray], Penguin, [Apro], [Colfax], James River, and many others around the world.  We believe a GPU can dramatically enhance the performance of a PC of any budget. We created ION to bring the benefits of the GPU to the smallest and most affordable PCs. The recently announced Acer Aspire Revo is a full Vista Premium PC available at the price of a basic entry level machine, yet it provides everything the mainstream consumer wants from a PC, including very high quality Blu-Ray playback and modern DX10 games. Because of the ultra-high integration and lower power of ION, Acer was able to create a small, quiet, provocative industrial design that is light enough to hang on the back of your display.  Last week, the first 5,000 Revos delivered to Germany e-tail sold out in one day. The Aspire Revo has been winning rave reviews. Digital Trends predicted that it should be one of the most successful desktop products released this year.  ION has forever changed what consumers can expect from the mainstream PC. Even affordable and small PCs can be wonderful and deliver the full PC experience. More ION based platforms will be available from virtually every major PC OEM. You can expect to hear a great deal in the months ahead about the many ION design wins.  At the World Mobile Conference in February, we revealed our Tegra Netbook. At less than one watt of power, Tegra can surf the web and present the full high resolution experience to the Internet. With Tegra, we are enabling a new class of web-based computers that is high resolution like a PC, yet always on like a smartphone. We now have Tegra design wins that range from portable media players, smartphones, netbooks and other new classes of mobile Internet devices. Research from iSupply projects shipments of Internet enabled devices ranging from ultra-mobile PCs to portable media players to increase nine-fold in the next four years.  More than 400 million of these devices will be shipped in 2012, an annual compound growth rate of better than 50%. We look forward to announcing exciting Tegra devices in the coming months. Our nearly four-year investment in Tegra has positioned us squarely at the center of the next computing revolution. We estimate that Tegra has opened up an additional $10 billion growth market for us.  Now let me introduce David White, who succeeded Marv Burkett earlier this year as CFO. David brings 25 years of experience to the role, most recently as CFO of [Samnia SCI]. He is already making a big impact here. I want to take this opportunity to thank Marv for his enormous contributions to NVIDIA over the past six years. Marv leaves a legacy that he can be very proud of. He is continuing in an advisory role, working with David and me to facilitate a smooth transition and taking on projects that can benefit from his expertise.  With that, let me turn the call over to David. \n",
      "David White: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. My comments today will focus on a review of our first quarter results of operations, both on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, along with a discussion of selected balance sheet accounts and cash flows. I will then conclude with comments regarding our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. As Jen-Hsun indicated in his opening comments, revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $664 million, which was up 38% from $481 million in the prior quarter, and significantly higher than our estimate, which was flat to slightly up.  We reported a GAAP net loss of approximately $201 million, or $0.37 per share. Our GAAP net loss included a one-time charge of $140 million associated with a cash tender offer we previously announced to purchase certain employee stock options. This compares to a GAAP net loss of $0.27 per share in the prior quarter.  Excluding the stock option tender offer, as well as other stock-based compensation, we reported a non-GAAP net loss for the quarter of $47 million, or a net loss of $0.09 per share. This compares with an $0.18 non-GAAP net loss per share in the prior quarter.  Let me now turn to our individual businesses -- our GPU business, which includes desktop, notebook, and memory -- represented 53% of our total revenue and recorded a 44% revenue increase quarter over quarter. Much of this increase was driven by the strength of the desktop segment, which was up almost 50% quarter over quarter. You will recall that last quarter’s revenue in this segment was negatively impacted by low sell-in to the channel as our channel partners worked to aggressively deplete excess inventories. Channel inventories now appear to have stabilized at slightly over one month’s supply, with our Q1 sales into the channel roughly approximately channel sales out. As such, our desktop revenue figures in Q1 more closely approximately true end-market demand than what we had experienced in Q4.  The notebook segment of our GPU business was up 28% quarter over quarter, driven primarily by increased OEM demand, which comprised the vast majority of this segment. Here also, fourth quarter revenues were abnormally impacted by OEM inventory corrections that have now abated.  Our MCP business, which represented 28% of our total revenue during the quarter, was up approximately 94% quarter over quarter. Demand was primarily driven by our chipset products designed for the mainstream AMD integrated desktop segment, as well as our chipset products designed for the Intel-based notebook segment.  Revenue for our PSB business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, was essentially flat quarter over quarter and represented 16% of total revenue. Our share in this segment remains stable -- corporate demand, which comprises a substantial percentage of this business, has not shown any signs of economic recovery at this point. This reflects constrained budgets and consumer redeployment and upgrade activity of older equipment.  Looking at the business as a whole, GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 28.6%. Excluding charges associated with a stock option tender offer, as well as other stock-based compensation, non-GAAP gross margin was 30.6%.  Our non-GAAP gross margin, which fell short of expectations and estimates, was impacted by several items. First, while revenue in our PSB business was flat quarter over quarter, as a percentage of total company revenue, it accounted for less of the total. Because our PSB business is generally more profitable than the rest of our business, this had an overall negative impact of approximately four points on gross margin.  Second, gross margin was also negatively impacted by the sell-off of some of our older 65-nanometer product, the effect of which was only partially offset by various reserve true-ups.  GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $421 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which again excluded charges associate with the stock option tender offer, as well as other stock-based compensation, amounted to $260 million, essentially flat quarter over quarter and consistent with our estimate.  Payroll related expenses were up quarter over quarter, due to the holiday shut-down in the fourth quarter, and additional FICA based payroll taxes we accrued in the first quarter. However, this increase was largely offset by cost reduction efforts that we realized elsewhere.  Our GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was a benefit of 10.4% and our non-GAAP tax rate was a benefit of 7.5%. NVIDIA's worldwide employment at the end of the quarter stood at 5,480, up 60 from the fourth quarter. We essentially have a hiring freeze in the U.S., with only the most critical positions being filled.  Turning to the balance sheet, accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $304 million, which equated to a DSO of approximately 42 days, an improvement of approximately 18 days from the prior quarter.  Inventories at the end of the quarter were $327 million, down $211 million, or 39% quarter over quarter. Inventory days at quarter end were 64. This compares with 145 days at the end of the prior quarter. These reductions resulted from rescheduling actions we took in response to our high inventory carryover from Q4, as well as early implementation of the staging of inventories at a pre-finished state just prior to custom configuration. We believe this latter change is important to us because it will enable us to better respond to changing market demand while at the same time maintaining overall inventory levels.  Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to approximately $51 million, slightly up from $48 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter amounted to $21 million, which as a result of our cost reduction efforts, was significantly down from the $43 million we spent in the prior quarter.  Accounts payable at the end of the quarter were $226 million, up approximately $7 million from the prior quarter, and our free cash flow for the first quarter was a positive $121 million.  Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities at the end of the quarter were approximately $1.34 billion, up approximately $83 million quarter over quarter. This figure is significant considering we paid out approximately $82 million associated with the stock option tender offer we completed in March.  In closing, let me briefly comment on our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2010. While it was particularly difficult during these economic times to place a high degree of certainly in market demand and the pricing environment we compete in, our outlook for the second quarter is as follows: we expect revenue to be up quarter over quarter in the range of 5%. As for gross margin, while we are not expecting any near-term improvement in demand in the workstation market, we do believe cost reduction efforts will allow us to improve margins. Accordingly, we expect our GAAP margins to be in the range of 32% to 34%.  We expect GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $280 million. \n",
      " : This concludes my remarks. I thank you for your time and with that, I would like to open the call up for questions. Operator, can we take questions at this point. \n",
      "Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Good afternoon, guys. Can we talk a little bit more about the inventory -- can you talk -- can you give us a little more detail about were there any inventory write-downs and did you sell through any -- or you mentioned you sold through some previously reserved inventory. Can you quantify a little better what the write-offs were or how much of the reserves that there were that you sold through with essentially zero cost, and how much still had some cost associated with it?\n",
      "David White: We have actually a couple of situations -- we have inventory that we completely wrote off in a prior period. We also have inventories that we wrote down to market value. Some of those inventories in both categories were sold during the quarter, some of which we had gains on, some of which we had losses on. It turns out that the losses we experienced on the sale of that inventory plus some of the other products actually offset that by a greater amount, and so on a net basis, it was actually a negative impact to the quarter. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: And was that basically because you, of the amount that you had written down, you hadn’t written it down enough?\n",
      "David White: That’s correct. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: So is that -- \n",
      "David White: In some cases. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: In some cases -- did that then trigger any other accounting accruals on the balance sheet and is that part of what explains the inventory, the big inventory drop as well?\n",
      "David White: There was also a modest amount of new lower cost [to market] accruals as well. On a net basis, it was negative, as I indicated. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Okay. Thanks, that makes sense. And then, when you talk about the gross margin improvement going into the next quarter, how much of -- number one, do you expect any additional inventory write-downs or do you expect to sell through any inventory that has previously been reserved for? And then can you help quantify a little bit further what that improvement is coming from? Is it just mix shift back to PSB or is it mix shift within GPU as well, perhaps some of the newer products, like the 40-nanometer products?\n",
      "David White: In the outlook for the second quarter, we’ll repeat much I think of the same scenario we had in the first quarter. We will continue to sell off some inventory that we have written off and we will continue to sell some inventory that we have written down to lower cost of market. Right now, I would anticipate that the net effect of those two would be roughly a wash. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Okay, and then what kind of improvement to gross margin do you expect from the mix shift to not just the professional solutions business but also from the newer products? The newer GPU products, I mean?\n",
      "Jenny Shanks: David, obviously we are ramping 40-nanometer very aggressively but we haven’t announced any new products yet, and so it’s not appropriate to talk about new products right now.  In terms of next quarter’s gross margins, obviously we have consumed a lot more of our 65-nanometer inventory this quarter and I think that the amount of our 65-nanometer inventory at this point is quite negligible. And so that is going to help our gross margins going forward.  Those are the biggest levers and we are looking forward to having the PSB business coming back online as the enterprise starts to buy again. We have really exciting new products for Quadro that we’ve launched and that the OEMs have already geared up, and so as soon as the end market comes back to life, I think that the workstation business is going to do really well for us once again. \n",
      "Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Okay, great. Thanks very much. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.\n",
      "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Thanks. Jen-Hsun, on the 40-nanometer, since you brought it up, I know you are not going to talk about new products that are not announced but can you give us an update on how the ramp is going relative to previous process nodes in terms of the ramp, the volumes, and can you give us an update on what percentage of the mix by the end of the year could be coming through that process node? Thanks. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Let’s see -- the ramp is going fine. It’s during the -- you know, we are ramping 40-nanometer probably harder than anybody and so we have three products in line now in 40-nanometer and more going shortly. So there’s -- this is a very important node. TSMC is working very hard. We have a vast majority of their line cranking right now with new products, and so we are monitoring yields and they are improving nicely week-to-week-to-week, and so at this point, there’s really not much to report.  In terms of the mix towards the end of the year, let’s see -- I haven’t -- my rough math would suggest about 25%, is my guess. I mean, there’s still going to be a lot of 55-nanometer products. A lot of our MCP products, ION, for example, is still based on 55-nanometer and ION is going to be running pretty hard. I think you heard in David’s comments earlier that our Intel chipset product line is our fastest growing business and so my sense is that that’s going to continue to be successful and that is still in 55-nanometer. So I would say roughly 25% to 30% is my rough estimate going into the end of the year. \n",
      "Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.\n",
      "Glen Yeung - Citigroup : Could you just clarify again your OpEx guidance for the July quarter? Because I think I heard that it’s going to be up Q-on-Q, and I just wanted to make sure I heard that right.\n",
      "David White: It’s not up. It’s about $280 million on a GAAP basis. \n",
      "Glen Yeung - Citigroup : On a GAAP basis -- and what would it be on a pro forma basis?\n",
      "David White: The guidance we are giving for SBC for next quarter is around $25 million. \n",
      "Glen Yeung - Citigroup : Okay, and then can you give us a sense, David -- when you look into the end of the fiscal year, for example, what are your thoughts about the kind of run-rate of operating expenses you expect to be on at that point, or really what I am asking, you make the point in the comments that you’ve got OpEx programs in place. I just want to get a sense of maybe what those are and what the targets are for that program. \n",
      "David White: So I think in the first quarter conference call, we talked about a stretched goal for the company of about $265 million, and we are still working aggressively to achieve that objective. We have a lot of programs, as Jen-Hsun talked about in his comments, that we absolutely want to maintain our investments in and we feel strongly about the return we will ultimately achieve from those investments. And so our cost reduction activities are trying to balance maintaining all of the resources we can on those investments and still trying to spend our money as wisely as we possibly can, and so we are focusing on a lot of ways in terms of how we manage our expenses and where our expenses are actually incurred, and trying to influence them in ways that won’t affect those programs. So I think the $265 million target is still intact and we are -- I assume we will achieve that sometime in the next -- certainly before the end of the calendar year and our fiscal year. \n",
      "Glen Yeung - Citigroup : Okay, and one last one maybe for Jen-Hsun -- maybe talk about the pricing environment that you are seeing out there. Obviously we are in a unique demand environment here and any sense that you are seeing anything unique on pricing as a result?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Pricing is -- I would characterize as aggressive, but we are at a point now with the pricing where we think that we are going to be relatively stable for some time. And our products gain a premium in the marketplace relative to the competition, because of the reputation of our products and the performance of our product and increasingly the work that we do around physics and CUDA is being recognized as important, and I commented earlier the number of games that are coming out with PhsyX in the game are -- it’s coming out in a really rich pipeline now and we are seeing game titles coming out on a regular basis now with PhsyX included.  And when you compare a game with PhsyX in it running on CUDA to one that is running on the CPU, the difference is so substantial that our GPU is just superior on so many different fronts. And so I think that we are going to leave our positioning in the marketplace with a premium to our products because it is a superior product and I think the market is recognizing that. \n",
      "Glen Yeung - Citigroup : Thanks. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.\n",
      "Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you very much. David or Jen-Hsun, anyone can answer -- can I please ask you about how the quarter progressed? Because if I look at the DSOs, it seems to have dropped off quite sharply, so can you just give me a sense of how, month-by-month, the quarter progressed in terms of demand? Because looking at this one made me conclude that it looks like demand tailed off towards the end of the quarter. Is that the right conclusion?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Actually, it didn’t. The quarter was a pretty solid quarter, I would say. In fact, we had spot shortages of several products and there were rumors of us pushing our supply chain really hard to get products out into the marketplace, and all of that is true. And we came into the quarter looking pretty good, so I think our -- the market is still uncertain and we monitor sell-out in every single geography for every single product like crazy these days, and so we’ll continue to watch it but so far, so good. \n",
      "Uche Orji - UBS: Okay. Just going back to -- David, going back to the margins, I think in the very first question, you were explaining that the impact of the inventory products that were sold, that the reserve was negative. So what is the cleanest gross margin? So if I walk off 30.6, and if I had to make adjustments for this inventory that were reserved and sold that had a negative impact -- I am trying to get a sense of what then is a clean gross margin for the quarter that just ended. \n",
      "David White: Well, I guess it depends on what your definition of clean is, I guess. Probably the single largest item that impacted margins in the quarter really is the fact that our workstation business, our PSB business, as we call it, was a smaller mix, percentage of the total mix. And as I indicated in my comments, that was about a four point hit on margins. And it overwhelms, actually, the other factors. It is the single largest item and as we gave our guidance, we are not anticipating at this point that is going to change any time soon, so if you wanted to find a clean quarter as our workstation business being back at the historical levels it’s been, you could add four points to margin.  I think the other items that I indicated are a much smaller consequence. \n",
      "Uche Orji - UBS: Sure. And just the last question on the workstation business, obviously watching the end markets [inaudible], it looks like things sure looked pretty challenged for some time. Let me ask you about competition in this market -- I mean, we’ve seen some of AMD’s products getting designed into some HP workstations. Are you starting to notice any signs of improved competition? Are these products getting any traction that may affect your longer term market share in this area? That’s my last question. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: We are frankly not seeing competitive pressure in our workstation business. I think the competition has repeatedly claimed design wins in the workstation business for years now and this is just not a -- it’s not a chip business. This is a chip and a system solution, system software. It’s a complicated business and you are building products that needs to not only be great at Windows but Linux and just about every ancient operating system on the planet. And so it’s a very, very complicated business and the reason why our market share is so high has a lot to do with the investment that we put into it, and so this is -- this is a business that is about solving some of the most challenging problems in computing in the world and we are really, really good at it, and so I think we read about press releases from the competition from time to time and we take it all seriously but the fact of the matter is, it just takes a lot more investment than that to be successful.\n",
      "Uche Orji - UBS: Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Thank you. A quick question on the ION revenue contribution -- you guys had a huge revenue upside in the first quarter. A lot of that was due to improving sellout demand. How much was that related to the ION business and a related question, what were the gross margins on the ION business and what were the pricing ASPs on the ION?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: So let’s see -- hey, David, what was our Intel chipset business this quarter? Do you have the numbers over there? Total Intel chipset business? We basically only have one Intel-based chipset that we are shipping in any meaningful amount, so -- \n",
      "David White: I don’t have it broken out, Jen-Hsun, between the two here with me. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: What was the total -- was it about $200 million, $180 million or so?\n",
      "David White: $180 million is the total. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Okay, and so I would expect about -- out of that $180 million, about two-thirds of it, maybe a little bit less than that comes from the ION chipset and the way to think about that is in Q2 of last year, one year ago, that amount was approximately zero and so that gives you a sense for the adoption of our products in that segment. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Right, but are you including the 9400M that you are showing to Apple as the -- as ION or is this actually two-thirds of that $180 million design wins with other companies outside of Apple that are using ION?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: We don’t distinguish the two -- I mean, it’s the same processor from our perspective. The -- we call it the platform ION and increasingly people are calling the chip ION, and so we don’t distinguish the two, whatever people want to call it. I mean, when people buy the chipset from us, they call it ION. When the put it into the box and they brand it from the outside, because GeForce is such a terrific brand and contributes so much to the brand value of the end product, people call it GeForce. Do you see what I’m saying? So people buy the ION but they sell it as a GeForce. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Yeah, I’m just trying to get a better understanding of what additional design wins with other PC manufacturers outside of Apple are you getting with ION? I am trying to get an understanding of again the traction of ION outside of just the Apple business that was announced a few quarters back.\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: If you estimate that Apple represents a little bit north of 50% of that, then I think it’s relatively correct. So the traction is good, and if you think about who the fastest growing PC companies are in the world, I think that’s Apple and Acer and [Asus Tech] and -- you know, they are all huge ION customers. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   And any sense of what the gross margins or ASPs on that platform were in this quarter?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: About or better than corporate average. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   The corporate average of this quarter of 30.6% or just what you have done historically?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Better than this quarter. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   All right. And then, can you give us any update in terms of the GT300 architecture, or the next generation architecture? Is that on schedule for the second half of ’09 or do you foresee any potential roadblocks with that rollout?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: We don’t comment about future products. Our current products are doing very, very nicely in the marketplace. What’s the point of talking about future products?\n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Okay, and just on the -- going on in terms of the revenue guidance of up 5%, how should we be looking at it in terms of individual business units? Should we be looking at kind of normal seasonality across the difference categories? And then should we be looking at the workstation business getting back up to like say 20% of total revenue, which has historically been in that range?\n",
      "David White: I would -- if I was modeling it out, I would assume workstation is flat and apply the 5% ratably to the other businesses. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   So even with the flat workstation business, which carries a higher gross margin, you are still expecting 32%, 34% of GAAP gross margin?\n",
      "David White: Yes. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Okay. What is it on a non-GAAP basis? Are you able to break that out?\n",
      "David White: It’s not much different. SBC is like 20 bps, 0.2 -- small difference. \n",
      "Rajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Stifel Nicolaus.\n",
      "Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Thank you. This is Patrick Newton in for Cody Acree. This question goes to Dave -- I guess if you could speak a little bit -- if we started looking out at long-term gross margin, what does it take to get us back into the 40% range? And I guess is this something that you guys think is achievable in the fiscal ’11 timeframe?\n",
      "David White: I guess I would throw in a couple of things here. One is -- Jen-Hsun, you can jump in here, obviously -- our business and margins are heavily influenced by our high-end performance products and clearly as we move forward and TESLA and TEGRA and some of these other products that we have been talking about and continue to invest in become a part of our revenue mix and so forth, we believe that within that time period, we can be getting our margins back up into that kind of arena. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: If you look at our history, there was a time when we were -- we had rather low gross margins, and I think it was as low as 28 points, or something like that. And we, over the course of about a year-and-a-half, methodically worked our gross margins back up and exceeded our record levels.  I have every confidence that the operational initiatives that we have in place today that looked at the reasons why our gross margins are challenged right now and the new mix of products that we are bringing to the marketplace and our -- you know, my full confidence that the industries will be revived and I will need to buy tools for their engineers, who are the hearts and souls of all industries, you know, will return. And when that happens, our gross margins have every opportunity to return to its record levels and potentially beyond. And so those are things that we are putting in place and the teams are executing fabulously across the board. If you watched us the last time, relentlessly march up our gross margins, we intend to do exactly the same this time. \n",
      "Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Thank you. And then moving on, so talking about some of these new products that you guys just touched on, TESLA and TEGRA, could you talk about what kind of revenue you saw from TESLA in this quarter, and maybe some kind of expectation throughout the remainder of the fiscal year? And then also in regard to TEGRA, if you could talk about some -- if there’s been any recent change in design win momentum and any expectations you have for TEGRA in the back half of the year ramping perhaps a target run-rate exiting the fiscal year?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: TESLA was many millions of dollars and next quarter will be more, is my expectation. The traction that we are getting designing them into clusters all over the world, as I mentioned in my comments, are really doing terrifically and the national labs around the world are all benefiting from stimulus packages as the various governments invest in energy exploration and investing in education, and so I think those are all -- and TESLA is just in a fine spot at the right time. And so my expectation is that TESLA is going to continue do to well and we will grow it into a rather nice business. Hopefully within the next couple of years into a business like Quadro and potentially larger.  TEGRA has -- we introduced a new category for TEGRA at the World Mobile Conference, and this is a TEGRA Netbook. Prior to that, we only had TEGRA smartphones and TEGRA portable media player design wins. Those products are just reaching the final production ready for final design phase and starting to ramp in production, and so we are -- I am expecting revenues this quarter and growing throughout the rest of the year. But this last quarter, we introduced a TEGRA netbook reference platform and we have many ODMs and OEMs working with us to bring TEGRA Netbook to the marketplace.  You know, the telcos have discovered that when they can give away a computer with a subscription and that computer is a couple hundred dollars, they can really drive subscription rates, and so we are pretty excited about this and the telcos are pretty excited about it as well, with 3G data modems becoming so affordable, this is really a terrific way for them to increase their revenues.  And the ARPU for a netbook that is high resolution and readily accessible so that you can stream high definition video or use Facebook wherever you are, the telcos are pretty enthusiastic about the type of ARPUs they will generate from these type of devices.  So I think this is going to be a new growth category for us and we are working really hard to get it to production. \n",
      "Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : And Jen-Hsun, when we think about TEGRA ASPs, is it right to think of smartphones and then later on, maybe another $10 for mids and then some incremental, maybe $10 for netbooks on top of that?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Let’s see -- help me understand your algorithm again. \n",
      "Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Sorry -- if I think of ASPs for smartphones maybe being in the $10, $15 range, mids being $10 more than that in the $25 type of range, and then netbooks a little bit more -- is that the right way to think of the ASPs for TEGRA?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: I would think of the PNPs to be very similar to smartphones. I think the mids are higher than that. I think your $10 is about right. And then I think netbooks on the high end of mids, so I agree with that. \n",
      "Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Perfect. Thank you very much. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gana with GMP Securities.\n",
      "Alex Gana - GMP Securities: Thank you very much. I am wondering about on the TESLA platforms how you get through or how you are working with potential customers to get some of the software that may be running on legacy hardware or standard hardware over to be TESLA compatible or adoptable in your systems?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: The vast majority of the serious computing clusters in the world run proprietary software. Oil and gas -- proprietary; finance, proprietary, and so there is a large internal development teams that protect these algorithms of theirs like we protect our algorithms and so we work with each one of their engineering teams or development teams to port to TESLA and the porting process is just all over the world and you could go -- and many of them when they do a port are so delighted by the results, they publish a paper. And if you go to Google and google CUDA GPU or NVIDIA CUDA GeForce GPU, you are going to find just reams and reams of paper that show the speed-ups that we talk about.  You can also come to CUDA Zone -- do a search on CUDA Zone and you will see a whole bunch of applications that have been ported and the results that they are seeing. So that’s one method.  We also work with software developers that target the verticals, and so they could be a small consulting firm for computational finance. They could be a small consult or large consulting firm for oil and gas discovery, so we work with them to develop software. And we will also port the major software packages like [Met Lab] and so there’s a piece of software that has been developed for [Met Lab] that accelerates [Met Lab] some 15, 20 times, and there’s some being developed again further to accelerating them further to that.  And so we just -- we approached these applications based on what we think has the greatest potential to serve the market and also the greatest potential for speed-up. And so we just -- we work on all of them at the same time with a rather large dev tech team, a developer relations team, and we are working with the software developers all over the world. And so you just have to work on this one at a time.  Now, the exciting thing about all of this is many of them were re-factoring and re-developing their software to run on multi-core CPUs and because they were so unsuccessful and frustrated by multi-core CPUs, TESLA showed up at exactly the right time, or CUDA showed up at exactly the right time. And so this is a -- this is really a perfect alignment of an industry that’s run out of choices but still needs to see significant speed. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\n",
      "Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could start out on the notebook market a little bit and give us a sense of what you are seeing in that market with respect to mix of discrete and integrated GPUs, and whether you see that -- any shifts that would be permanent there?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Well, in the notebook market, the discrete versus integrated has been relatively stable, I think. Probably about 25% of the notebooks are discrete. It might have been a little lower this quarter -- well, it probably is lower this quarter because of the significant growth of netbooks. And so if you excluded the netbooks, my sense is that discreet has probably gained relatively to integrated graphics. But let’s just assume that it’s relatively flat and going forward, the interesting dynamic is -- and we are anxious to see this play out but we are starting to hear from all over the world that integrated graphics don’t have DX Computer. DX Computer is the single most important new API from Windows 7 and it helps you do amazing things. If you have made a home movie and you put it on your PC and you wanted edit -- you know, add video editing and add some special effects to it and stitch a few photos and videos together, and you want to render it back to a DVD so you can send it to grandparents -- you know, that process without GPU computing is horrific. I mean, to make a one-hour movie, it will probably take you 10 hours to record it. And so with DX Compute, that one hour has become one hour and one hour, and so it’s just a revolutionary speed-up when it comes down to certain types of application that are very parallel and very data intensive, very computer intensive.  And so I think without DX Compute on integrated graphics chips, the question is how will these PCs compete? And so we are seeing a lot more interest in people who need to put GPUs in their notebooks and desktop computers when Windows 7 comes around. \n",
      "Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thanks, and maybe just as a follow-up, could you give us an update on the magnitude of revenues you expect from TESLA in the current fiscal year, please?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: You know, it’s really hard to say exactly but if we did less than $50 million, I would be disappointed and I would be delighted if we are on a run-rate of north of $100 million going out of the year. \n",
      "Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks very much. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with Friedman, Billings, Ramsay.\n",
      "Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: This is Robert for Craig. Thanks for taking my question -- can you give us a better idea of what ASPs did in the quarter for desktops and notebooks for your chips? Thank you. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: David, you probably have that over there. \n",
      "David White: Probably most of our compression on ASPs probably came in the GPU line of our business in some select particular models and so forth. It was a little bit higher this last quarter than what we have traditionally seen on some particular programs on a quarter over quarter basis, that is. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: If you look at ASPs quarter to quarter, it surely should have increased because we gained share in most of our -- well, almost all of our share gains came from the high end. So we gained about 6% share over quarter over quarter, and so that should -- all of that is high-end share, so our ASP should have gone up. \n",
      "Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: And then going forward, do you expect your ASPs to be stable from here, I guess on the lower end stuff?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: I would say that ASPs are relatively stable right now and we are focused on differentiating our products with PhsyX and with CUDA, with GPU computing and the competition’s products are really graphics only and as more and more applications come out that have GPU computing capabilities and ports, and as more and more games have physics, we are going to focus on differentiating that way. S\n",
      "Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with J.P. Morgan.\n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Just honing in on the gross margins for a second, can you clarify something -- did you say that the inventory that you got in, you had an inventory reserve benefit in Q1, did I hear that correctly?\n",
      "David White: What I indicated was that we had inventory true-ups, some of which were unfavorable, some of which were favorable, the net of which, when you netted that against the products that they related to and we sold was a net unfavorable impact on the quarter. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: So it hurt gross margins?\n",
      "David White: Correct.\n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then on the segment level, given the -- if you ex out the options write-down, did your desktop and notebook gross margins fall sequentially, GPU?\n",
      "David White: What was the first part of that though? Can you repeat the first part of that?\n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: If you take out that $11 million charge to COGS and you just look at your segment gross margins, desktop GPU, notebook GPU -- \n",
      "David White: Yeah, we don’t typically look at that included in there anyway. Okay, yes, I understand what you are saying -- no, they did not. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: They did not fall sequentially? \n",
      "David White: Correct. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. So circling back then to the reserve, bad news, what was the dollar magnitude of that?\n",
      "David White: We’ve really not broken that out. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: I see. Okay, and then as options, looking at options going forward, are they going to stay at the $25 million run-rate?\n",
      "David White: That’s about right. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then as far as channel inventories, Jen-Hsun, earlier you mentioned that you believe that at this -- and this is what we are all trying to figure out, is what is in-demand, what is catching up with in-demand -- how do you see channel inventories right now and as you look at your various lines of business, including chipsets, desktop, notebook, which do you think still have some catch-up to do and which do you think have caught-up with in-demand?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: It’s harder for us to tell on notebooks because we don’t monitor sell-outs on notebooks. They are OEM products. But in terms of desktop products, we know that our channel inventory is near all-time lows, and so we continue to have spot shortages of products here and there. And so we are -- my sense is that based on what we are selling in and based on what is selling out and what we believe the channel inventory to be, the market looks relatively stable right now. \n",
      "Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Thank you very much. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Global Crown Capital.\n",
      "David Wu - Global Crown Capital: Yes, I am afraid I need some help on understanding gross margin guidance for Q2 -- since the workstation business is not -- it’s not moving up or down as a percentage of revenue, I see a significant bump in your gross margin guidance for Q2. Is that a function of the mix of 55-nanometer or any new products relative to 65-nanometer to give you this meaningful lift in gross margin quarter on quarter?\n",
      "David White: That is certainly a piece of it, yes, absolutely.  \n",
      "David Wu - Global Crown Capital: So that must be the biggest piece, right? Because essentially we are not talking about major differences between workstation business and the rest of the company. \n",
      "David White: Well [there are other] cost reduction measures that we’ve taken as a company. \n",
      "David Wu - Global Crown Capital: I see. Okay. The other thing I was wondering, essentially to expect a nice recovery in the professional solutions business, I guess just look to IT spending, is that the way to look at it? If we have an IT spending recovery in the second half of this calendar year, then the highest gross margin business would come back. \n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: I think that’s not a bad surrogate, but we also have to think along the lines of creating new products that can save our customers money. We demonstrated at the National Association of Broadcasters the world’s first digital in graphics compositor digital out product and it’s -- we call it Quadro DVP, digital video pipeline. And it’s the first of its kind ever built and it replaces quite a large amount of servers and switches and video mixers and the reception has been just fabulous. And so what we need to do is get into production. As you know, more and more of the broadcasters are streaming off on the web and this product is designed to be able to record in real-time and composite in real-time and stream it real-time on the web. And so that is a growth market and so we think that there are opportunities for us to innovate our way out of this, even if the IT spending doesn’t come back in the near future. So we have all kinds of ideas that we are working on. You’ve been following us a long time -- we’re a pretty relentless bunch of guys and we have lots of good ideas and in spite of challenges, there are always ways to grow.  You know, you look at ION, it’s our fastest growing business because we’ve tapped into a movement towards low-end advanced mainstream computing. You saw that we are gaining share. You saw that we are creating new products like TESLA and TEGRA, both of which saves money, and so we can find new ways to grow, even if the economy is challenged. \n",
      "David Wu - Global Crown Capital: Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Suji DeSilva with Kaufman Brothers.\n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Good afternoon, guys. Nice job on the quarter and inventories there -- in the 5% sequential guidance, is that typical -- is that the linearity you are expecting that similar typical years or is this year any different somehow?\n",
      "David White: Traditionally our July quarter is seasonally the weaker quarter of the year, one of the weakest quarters of the year.\n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: I meant the linearity month to month. \n",
      "David White:  In terms of the second quarter or the first quarter?\n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Correct -- no, the coming quarter. \n",
      "David White: I think the second quarter will be pretty close to the same linearity we had in the first quarter, which was better than average. \n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Okay, and then as we look at the consumer ultra low voltage, CULV opportunity, is that neutral for you, Jen-Hsun, or do you think that’s an opportunity in terms of your content?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: That’s neutral for us because we don’t participate in the mid-range of notebooks anyhow. If you look at our historical notebook participation, we have been only on the top third of the market and the bottom two-thirds of the market has been integrated for just about forever.  We entered into the low-end part of the marketplace recently with MCP 79 or ION and so we are taking share in the mainstream and the low-end part of the market. What’s exciting to me is come Windows 7 and when DX Compute comes out, the difference between a computer that has DX Compute accelerated by a GPU versus one that does not is not a 10%, 15%, it’s 10, 20, 30 times. I just don’t know how -- and it’s not for games. It’s for making movies for your grandparents. And we know that one of the fastest growing consumer products right now is the flip video camcorder and the Sony Wedding -- those things are selling like hotcakes, and they are HD camcorders. People are making home movies and they want to create a home movie and post it on the web or burn a DVD. And so I think the -- finally it’s possible to do video editing because of DX Compute and because of the GPU underneath it that is not excruciating. I mean, it’s a delightful experience and one of these days, if you get a chance to drop by, we’ll just show you how to do it. It’s just incredibly easy. When you can move a video file around and store it the way that you save files, you know, it changes everything.  This is going to be one of the major usage models for Windows 7 and so we are excited about that and I think that all computers, and I made this comment in my remarks, that we believe and certainly I believe that every computer will benefit with GPUs in it. It will reduce the power.  One of the most -- if you read review so the Macbook Air, that has a rather large GPU, GeForce 9400, in a ultra thin and light computer and the power is better than it was before with Intel integrated graphics. People remark about that all over the web, and so it’s because GPUs, using the right tool to do the right job, saves power and when BNP Paribas and others discover that by using the GPU, you can save 200 times the energy because you run a process faster and it consumes less power, you save a lot of energy and energy consumption comes right out of the battery. And so I think that more and more people are just starting to discover that adding another processor that does the right job on the right -- you know, using the right tool for the right jobs, it really saves power, really saves energy. \n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Great, that’s helpful color and one last question, if I can squeeze it in -- Jensen, in terms of TEGRA versus ION, which one do you think has a larger unit TAM? I’m assuming -- I think it’s TEGRA but if you can confirm that. And which one do you think will have more units in the marketplace in say two to three years, TEGRA or ION?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Oh my gosh, TEGRA -- TEGRA, of all of the products in our company, TEGRA has long-term the largest TAM. And the number of -- \n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: In two or three years, you believe there will be more TEGRAs out there?\n",
      "Jen-Hsun Huang: Oh yeah, I think in two or three years -- surely, surely. I think the -- TEGRA is -- you know, we’ve been investing in TEGRA now for about four years and we have one of our best teams in the company working on this. There’s 500 people working on TEGRA and to build a computer completely from scratch that first on the size of a penny and deliver a full high definition experience, consume less than one watt, it’s just -- when you see it, it’s just absolutely magical and we -- it’s possible to do that and we are just blowing people away when we show it to them. This is -- I really believe this is the second personal computer revolution. We happen to be fortunate to have in our careers experienced two computing revolutions. This is it. We want to be all over it, and so this is an exciting time for TEGRA. \n",
      "Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck, guys. \n",
      "Operator: There are no more questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jen-Hsun. Please go ahead. \n",

      "Kelly P. Hernandez - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Saeed, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter calendar year 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Sopp, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of the Leidos management team. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter ending April 3, 2015. Roger Krone will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company's strategies. Mark will follow with a discussion of our financial performance for the first quarter and our expectations for the future. After these remarks from Roger and Mark, we'll open the call up for your questions. During this call, we will make references to year-over-year comparisons. Due to the previously announced change in our fiscal year, we will be comparing our just released Q1 calendar 2015 results for the quarter ended April 3, 2015 with our previously reported Q1 fiscal 2015 results, which represent the three months ending May 2, 2014. During the call, we will also make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding the company and our expectations about future financial and operating performance. These statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events to differ materially, and I refer you to our SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. In addition, statements represent our views as of today. Subsequent events and developments could cause our view to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. Finally, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the supplemental information on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kelly. And thank you, all, for joining us this morning for our first quarter, calendar year 2015 earnings conference call. Before I begin, I'd like to spend a moment to thank our CFO, Mark Sopp, on what is likely his last earnings call with Leidos. As you know earlier this year, Mark announced his intention to retire from Leidos, and we are in the final stages of selecting his successor. Mark has been with the company for nearly 10 years and was involved in our initial public offering in 2006 and has been instrumental in growing the company from roughly $7 billion a year in annual revenues to more than $11 billion annually before the spinoff. We wish Mark success and happiness as he embarks on this new chapter in his life. While we're on the topic of management changes, I am pleased to announce that we have successfully concluded the search for our Health and Engineering Sector President. This individual will be joining Leidos in the coming weeks, and we will be making an announcement regarding his appointment shortly. On to the quarter. This morning, we announced our financial results for the first quarter of calendar year 2015. Revenues, earnings per share and cash flow came in generally as expected and we are tracking well to the annual guidance we provided on our last call. Our book-to-bill, both on a consolidated basis and specifically in the national security sector, is up from year-ago levels. While this is a positive development, we recognize that there is still more progress to be made and the true reflection of our BD improvements have yet to bear fruit in this metric. We are making steady progress in our engagement with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, and in April, we signed a contract for the logistics, commodities and service transformation program or LCST. Mark will give you more details on this contract in his remarks. Beyond this, a few other notable wins I'd like to highlight. A $7.2 billion multiple award IDIQ contract by the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command to provide global intelligence support services, $100 million multiple award prime contract by the National Institutes of Health to provide professional information technology and technical services to the NIH Center for Information Technology, a $50 million single award IDIQ prime contract from the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic to provide environmental planning and mission operation support for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft. We are also extremely proud of our federal health team for having won the AHLTA CHCS sustainment contract which was awarded to Leidos by the Defense Health Agency on April 30. AHLTA CHCS is the current electronic health record system supporting the DoD worldwide. As a reminder, the original contract for CHCS was awarded to Leidos more than two decades ago, and we are deeply honored to have been chosen by the DoD DHA in successive competitive acquisitions over this period of time. This award was the result of a highly competitive acquisition process spanning approximately 17 months. Due to timing, we will book this into backlog in Q2. We are pleased that the DoD continues to entrust us with sustainment responsibilities for this mission-critical system having chosen Leidos as the best value solution. Another highlight during the quarter relates to our security products business, which resides within our Health and Engineering sector. Leidos is one of only three companies that has achieved certification by the GSA on its version 7.2 standard for its medium speed explosives detection system. This new standard requires the inspection systems to be able to detect materials of considerably greater complexity and broader composition than in the past. We are currently the only provider of reduced size EDS systems to the TSA. But this most recent achievement will allow us to compete in a new market when the TSA upgrades their aging checked baggage systems. Now, to provide you with an update on portfolio shaping. The sale of our Plainfield Renewable Energy facility is progressing as expected. And we continue to believe the transaction with Greenleaf Power will close in the coming months. There is more to go on portfolio shaping as we continue to evaluate our various businesses. However, we have nothing further to report for now, and we will update you at the appropriate time. Finally, on cash flow and capital deployment, during the first quarter, we had a net use of cash for operating activities of $42 million which was in line with our expectations. We recognized the importance of deploying our excess cash. Our first priority for capital deployment remains paying our dividend. Beyond that, uses for cash or investing for future growth, managing our financial leverage consistent with being considered investment grade and returning value to shareholders. All of these options are evaluated every quarter with our board. Overall, I'm pleased with the quarter and the progress we are making in expanding our served markets, improving our business development results and focusing the company on our core competencies. Our priorities remain on our people, our innovation and our cost, and I firmly believe we are on the right track in all of these areas, not just in the quarter we reported but in what lies ahead. I'd also like to take a moment to recognize our employees for the hard work and dedication to the company and to our customers. Leidos recently received two honors recognizing the culture that our employees have helped to create. First, we were named as one of America's best employers for 2015 by Forbes magazine. And second, we were named again this year, as one of the best employers for veterans by Military Times, for our continued commitment to veteran hiring and retention. I want to thank all of our employees and our hiring managers for their instrumental part in earning these honors for the company. With that, let me hand the call over to Mark Sopp.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Roger, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. It's a good start to the year and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. Consolidated revenues were $1.25 billion for the first quarter, which represents a decline of 5% compared to the first quarter of last year. The pace of revenue declines continue to moderate now for the sixth sequential quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of $80 million represents a margin of 6.4%, down slightly compared to the prior year. As we'll discuss in the sector details, these results include the impact of some discrete expenses, most notably in facilities exit costs which we experienced in January 2015. As a result of the fiscal year change, these discrete items are being reported twice in this calendar first quarter and also in the fourth quarter of our last first fiscal year ended January 30. In total, these discrete items represented a 70-basis-point dilution to our non-GAAP consolidated operating margin in calendar Q1. Excluding which, margins for the quarter would have been 7.1%. Q1 margins were quite strong for our operating sectors, but were offset by higher than normative cost in the corporate segment and I'll cover more on this in a little bit. Conversely, our effective tax rate during the first calendar quarter was below our normative rate as expected due to a combination of beneficial impacts recognized during January 2015 reported both in Q4 of last fiscal year and here again in Q1 of calendar 2015. A more normative quarterly tax rate and what we expect for the rest of this year is approximately 37%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.65, up from $0.59 in the prior year as detailed on slides 16 and 17 of the investor presentation on our website. This was as expected driven by lower net interest expense and lower effective tax rate, and a lower share count from buybacks made in 2014. Operating cash flow used from continuing operations was $42 million and generally in line with our expectations. Receivables management was strong during the quarter resulting in DSOs up 71 days, a 5-day reduction year-over-year. This was offset by a high concentration of annual payments which typically occur in Q1, including annual bonuses and 401(k) contributions. Further, during the first quarter, we incurred a higher level of tax payments relative to our tax provision, which will largely reverse later in the year. Taking the business development results consolidated net bookings totaled $891 million in the first quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.72, slightly above the year ago quarter. We are encouraged by the recent wins and improvements we are making in our BD process. But as Roger said, we recognize, it'll take more time to see the full benefits of recent actions in our book-to-bill metrics given the length of our 12- to 18-month sales pipeline. We ended the quarter with $7.5 billion in total backlog including $2.8 billion which was funded well more than six months of forward revenue coverage. I will point out these book-to-bill and backlog numbers do not yet include any impact from the United Kingdom LCST contract. I'll provide more detail on that contract in a few moments when I cover the National Security Solutions sector. The value of bids outstanding at the end of the first quarter was $16.2 billion, up roughly 35% from Q1 of last year and roughly flat sequentially from Q4. We expect this will decline noticeably once the LCST win shifts from outstanding bids to backlog. Turning now to the select sector results for the first quarter. First, in our National Security Solutions sector, NSS, revenues decreased year-over-year by $82 million or 9%. 70% of this decline was due to the continued reduction in U.S. overseas war related or overseas contingency operations funded business otherwise known as OCO. This pace of the OCO decline is progressing as expected, and we continue to believe our OCO revenues will come in near $200 million for calendar 2015. When adjusting for the OCO decline, our NSS revenues contracted approximately 3% during the quarter, primarily driven by the overall reductions in defense and U.S. government spending outlays from prior year budgets. On to profitability, operating margins in our NSS sector decreased from 8.2% in Q1 of last year to 7.2% this quarter. This decrease again reflects the effect of facilities exit cost discussed on our last call which were incurred in January 2015. Excluding this impact, NSS operating margins were 7.7% this quarter. Before I move on to Health and Engineering, I do want to share some more details with you regarding the UK LCST contract. As Roger mentioned upfront, we did signed the contract in April, however we still must meet certain conditions precedent in order for the program to become effective. We expect those to be resolved in either Q2 or Q3 of this year. Once these items are resolved we expect to book into backlog in the upper $2 billion range in expected revenue contribution from this program over its 13 year term. This figure reflects our expectation that we will use in net accounting on portions of the contract, meaning we do not expect record revenue on the pass through commodity purchases that we will be making on behalf of the Ministry of Defense. Under that assumption, we expect the contract to generate revenues for Leidos of approximately US$225 million per year on a typical run-rate basis. This approximate revenue run-rate represents 5% of our trailing 12 month revenues. Certainly a nice organic growth driver for the company going forward. We expect margins for this contract to start lower in the initial stage and ramp closer to the broader NSS operating margins over time. This contract is structured as a gain share contract which means there is a financial incentive for us to deliver ongoing cost reductions to the Ministry of Defense for the procurement and logistics solutions that we will deliver. These dynamics represent margin upside opportunities over the long term. And finally, please note this contract is denominated in pound sterling. And as such, we will have some level of currency exchange risk in our operating results going forward. As we develop greater visibility and precision on net cash flows related to this program, we will determine whether implementation of the currency hedging program is appropriate. Now on Health and Engineering or HES. HES revenues for Q1 calendar 2015 increased by $13 million or 3% year-over-year with growth driven by our engineering business. Q1 operating margins for the sector as reflected on slide 6 of our earnings presentation on our website include the impact of the previously disclosed $40 million Plainfield power plant impairment recorded in January 2015, as well as $6.4 million of operating losses from the plant during the quarter. When adjusting for these elements, Q1 operating margins for the sector was 10.2%. This represents a nearly 200-basis-point increase from the prior year period and is reflective of strong profitability performance of our security products business and the continued actions we have taken to rightsize the cost structure for other Health and Engineering elements particularly on the commercial health side. Due to the commercial and product aspects of our Health and Engineering sector, margins are more volatile and are significantly impacted by the timing of commercial health volumes and security product shipments. Just an update on the latter as we have talked about for a few quarters now, we had a large security products order in the Middle East but had not shipped products nor recorded revenue for various reasons. We recently satisfied all necessary conditions required to commence shipment and are making our initial shipment to the customer this month. Due to timing in contractual terms, we expect to recognize revenue from this shipment in Q3 rather than in Q2 as we originally had expected. During the first quarter, our corporate segment had a net cost of $17 million. This is a bit higher than our normative rate due to a combination of factors including facilities exit costs and legal costs which were incurred in January and also reflected in our Q4 fiscal 2015 results. The more normative annual run rate we expect for the corporate sector is in the $40 million to $45 million range. Now, moving on to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for calendar 2015 on all metrics. We continue to expect revenues in the range of $4.6 billion to $5.0 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $2.20 to $2.45 and cash flow from operations at or above $200 million. In conclusion, we're off to a good start in the year, and I'm encouraged by the improved climate in our end markets and most significantly by the contributions of our employees to position Leidos and our customers for future success. Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues and fellow gifted employees here at Leidos and also the investment community and our shareholders for all of your support in the near decade that I've been in this role. The greatest experience I will take away is seeing firsthand the power and impact that our dedicated employees have had on our customers and also our nation. That positive force allows me to depart with the utmost pride in our company and confidence that Leidos is only at the beginning of great things to come. With that operator, let's now open it up for questions.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much, and, Mark, job well done. So, a quick question on the LCST contract. I think you said that you have a $30 million upfront kind of cash flow need as you build inventory. If you're starting out with margins a bit below the sector average, is it that basically it's going to take you three years to basically earn that back or does that cash flow start to turn positive in the second year? Thanks.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Cai. First, it's Mark. Thank you for your earlier remark. I would say that the $30 million includes both inventory and receivables just to clarify that. And we have in our expectations a very favorable ROI for the program overall. The working capital consumption in years two and beyond is very low and attractive for us, and so we do expect a reversal, of course, and positive cash flows, maybe not in the second year but by the third or fourth, we expect to be in positive territory.\n",
      "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. And maybe you could give us an update on DHMSM.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, hey, great, Cai. Good morning. This is Roger. Let me just kind of bring you up to speed on where we are. So, DHMSM is the DHA electronic health records modernization program and fairly complex program that has gone through several phases. We have submitted – actually, I think yesterday what we would call our IPR which is another milestone in the program. So, we had prior submittals, we had questions, we've met with the customer and done orals. That has led us to updating our proposal, and submittal of this thing called an IPR. Now, the customer will evaluate the IPR, give us scoring against our technical offering and respond back. And that should happen, I would say, in weeks. And then, what will happen next is with that, they will ask for the final price revision or best and final offer, and we will go to final on the submittal we think four to six weeks from now with an award decision we think coming out in the July-August timeframe. So, it's been a long road, we think. We see a light at the end of the tunnel. And frankly, we're very pleased with where we find ourselves at this point.\n",
      "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. And one last one. Commercial health, could you give us some updates? I guess you said that the revenues were down. How much were they down? And basically is that business starting to show any signs of life on the order book?\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In terms of year-over-year, it was down double digits, Cai. But we see signs of stabilization. We have new members of the team, Roger referred to one that's coming on board shortly but others there and just came out of the very positive trade show experience with the team. And so it's good signals there. On the other hand, it still remains to be a low visibility business 60 days to 90 days of visibility. And that's why we need to be cautious in our outlook and move very methodically in our steps to expand our offerings in the solutions and records exploitation phase and revenue management and so forth and build the team.\n",
      "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. Congrats to Mark. Wondering if you are going to let your hair down now. Given that we seem to be moving forward with a 2016 federal budget that wants to use the OCO mechanism rather than raise the base budget, how is that impacting your client decision-making, given that they are back to looking at short-term funding and not a long-term visibility?\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Great question. Of course, we're all watching what's going on down the street in Washington. Even although the Congress seems to be asking for more money, it's not clear that the president is going to give them everything that they're looking for, and it would appear this year as in past, we may use OCO to make up the difference. First, and I would say, I think we have all sort of predicted this. So, this is not a new behavior. And to the extent it has affected customer behavior, that's a little bit baked into our projections already. But if you want a general answer, the general answer is people tend to be delaying and procurements tend to move to the right. However, I've been doing this a long time, and I could make that statement in both good times and bad that nothing ever happens quite on the schedule that the procurement official would like. But I'm a little bit more optimistic, frankly, this year than I may have been in prior years, but we're getting more dialogue between the Hill and the White House. And frankly, with Ash Carter, I think he's been a lot more proactive in spending time with the Hill and reaching out, trying to get those funding that he needs to run the Department of Defense.\n",
      "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Could you talk a little bit about pricing in the non-commodity part of your efforts? Is it easing up? Are the clients starting to pay for value or is pricing still pretty tight across the board?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Well, let's start with probably the most apparent dialogue and that is Frank Kendall and Better Buying Power 2.0 and 3.0. And it's clearly stated that he does not want to stretch his budget on the back of making this an attractive place for companies to compete. And so, the dialogue is there. We have seen – I think various program managers interpret that in different ways. I think rather than see overall pressure on profitability, we see different contract types. So where we might have seen firm fixed price, we now see fixed-price incentive. Where we would have seen more flexible pricing and development, we see more award fees. I think, again, with (29:59) and Frank, they're going to hold their industry's feet to the fire. But I think if you perform, you'd be able to achieve margins at historical levels. And we've done a great job of executing and our historical levels have been pretty steady.\n",
      "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: The Defense Department has sort of been asking the contractors to step up and fund some R&D for them. Where is Leidos in that view, their willingness to provide unfunded R&D?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Well, there's been some complex discussions around R&D and IR&D recovery with the customer. Let me answer your question first and then come back to some of the policy discussions that are going on. First, we're going to spend more on R&D this year than we spent in last. We are a technology oriented company and we think it's important to spend targeted IR&D – frankly CSR&D on the commercial side and we actually have some pretty innovative programs we're running out of our corporate office to encourage innovation in the line. We have sort of some very entrepreneurial monies that we spend to do very far-out R&D. The conversations we've had with DoD had been more around how does the department optimize the spend of the entire industry. And if you've been a student of the industry for a long time and I know that you have. We used to have a lot of oversight into how we spent our IR&D. We had to write something called IR&D recovery brochure, and we had to have a sponsor in the government. They essentially proactively managed the industry spend. We went from that to where whatever you could afford in your overhead you were allowed to spend and there was much less oversight from DoD on our R&D. I see the pendulum swinging back slightly to where Frank wants to optimize the amount of money that he spent industry-wide that's in G&A. We're not sure how that's going to manifest itself, and we're working with Frank directly and through industry organizations like AIA to make sure that's done in a thoughtful way. And that's all embodied in this Better Buying Power 3.0.\n",
      "Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you, and all the best Mark.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Ed.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Raviv from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning. A follow-up question on the UK contracts. You talked about $225 million, below-average margins. When can we expect that to ramp? Is that kind of like we got a half year this year and then a full year next year, or believe it's slower or faster than that?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: What I'd like to do with that question and maybe to expand a little bit on what's going in the UK is to introduce Lou Von Thaer who is president of our National Security Solutions sector. Lou and his team have been working for years on this terrific win for Leidos and Lou is here with us and I would ask Lou just to answer more color on what's going on in revenue and profitability and a little bit about what we are going to do for the UK government.\n",
      "Lou Von Thaer - President, National Security Sector, Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Well, thank you Roger. And Jon thanks for the question. But let me start with a little bit on the contract itself because it's a very interesting contract for us, and it's one that we're extremely proud of our team and extremely proud to be part of. This contract will really transform the MOD's entire material stores management and distribution networks. It's not the implementation of simply one system or staff augmentation, or putting oil cans and tires on shelves. It's the beginning of an enterprise-wide transformation for parts of the MOD. The scope of the engagement encompasses information systems, business process optimization, streamlining and optimization of storage and distribution networks, enhancing and optimizing the demand planning and forecasting systems that the MOD will use for all their forward deployed services. There's a lot of science to this and we're very pleased that the customer has entrusted us to deliver the solution for them, as we've done in past engagements with the U.S. DoD and NATO. Really proud of the team. We've been working on this and we've had dozens of people from across the company doing 14-hour days for the last couple of years. And to be fair, MOD team has done the same level of work on this and the same level of dedication. And I think it's been a great partnership. We're very happy to come through the competition. And it's impossible to ever recognize all the people who contribute to something like this. But I do want to call out a few of our key people that deserves special notoriety: Michael White, Scott Handley were our business development or business manager and contracts leads; Mitch Stevenson was our Deputy of the Contract; and Barb Doornink was our Senior Vice President and now our Managing Director, who is actually staying in-country for the next several years to work this. So, this is a 13-year contract, 3-year transition, 10-year operation after that. And there's actually an option for an additional two years at the end of that potentially, if they decide to go to a re-compete and go to the next stages. So, if we look at how the contract starts up, this year, we expect some phenomenal revenues. We expect it to build relatively quickly next year into that $225 million, maybe even a little bit higher range that Mark spoke to. And the margins we expect will start lower, but by the end of the transition, we should be starting to approach to that three-year transition. We should be getting in the range of the typical earnings rates for the NSS sector as we look. And as we look at this, we already see the customer starting to talk about potential add-ons to the contracts. So, we'll play those out over time as we get up and start to execute. I think they're hoping to use this as a model for how other parts of MOD could take advantage of this contract and this actual application of systems. So, time will tell. We have a lot of hard work to do. But the team's off and running very well. As Mark mentioned, we signed the contract, and we expect over – hopefully this quarter but certainly by third quarter to have the final contracts precedence completed. Those are actually in place because the original intent was to award the contract before Christmas and then have it in place to operate when the award slipped out. Both sides wanted to make up as much time as possible to get the contract up and running as soon as possible. So, because of that, there's a few actions on both our side and the MOD side to complete a few of the contract actions. And those are well under way. We don't see any of those as significant issues.\n",
      "Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks for that extensive answer. Lou, while I have you, you talk about normative NSS or typical NSS margins. What is that really, in your mind? I know we're under pressure this year. But is this a 7.5% business, an 8% business? Have you ever thought about a number there?\n",
      "Lou Von Thaer - President, National Security Sector, Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Oh, I think about it all the time. I think as Mark said earlier, we've certainly seen some facility and other costs that have kind of taken from that. But typically, we're in the 8% range. We've said that before. I think when we pull out all the pieces, we continue to operate around that range. And we really don't see anything in the portfolio that would change that substantially over the next few years.\n",
      "Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Can you stay in the 8%s even as LCST ramps?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think so.\n",
      "Lou Von Thaer - President, National Security Sector, Leidos Holdings, Inc.: I think in the first year, there won't be – the sales probably won't have a material impact. And in the second year, again, around 8%, we may see a few basis points up or down time to time. But I don't see a marginal change.\n",
      "Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Loomis from Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you and good luck, Mark, with your next ventures.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you very much, Bill.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just looking at the margins on the commercial healthcare within Health and Engineering, what is that? How much did the product sales boost margins to the adjusted 10%? I'm just trying to get a sense of what that volatility might be with the product sales versus a sustainable commercial healthcare margin.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The first – Bill, again, thanks for the comment. We don't like to give too much detail on the components of the sectors from profitability perspective. I would like to go back and expand on my remark on commercial health earlier. While it did have meaningful revenue declines, I tip my hat to the team, they are profitable. In Q1, meaningful level, not up to the full margin level of the company, but still respectable and they've done a good job managing cost to achieve that. And I'll just reiterate that as you know, when we have meaningful product deliveries out of our security products business, it is our highest margin business in the company. And they've done a wonderful job for many years balancing their products and their maintenance streams to produce among the more attractive returns in that space. And we expect that to continue as they have meaningful volumes quarter-to-quarter, and that's why there is the type of volatility we saw on the first quarter being very strong. Other quarters will depend on the security product shipment levels and the overall level of business across our commercial space to include commercial engineering and health.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, just on the Middle East product sales that you expect to recognize in third quarter, is that a very high margin? And given the size are we going to see a margin – an adjusted margin greater than 10% in the second half?\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'm not going to predict what our precise margin is going to be in the third quarter, but I think that because of the push there will be a little bit of stress in the second quarter from a margin perspective for the contribution that we will or we hope to see from security products that will be pushed to the right. So, bear that in mind. But for the same reason Q3 should be relatively strong assuming that revenue recognition does occur in that period of time. Dealing with international shipments and installations and ultimate acceptance, there is some risk to that. But that's our current estimate is to hit that in Q3 and I would say that this particular order with this Middle East customer is at a profit level similar to the rest of our security products business.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Then just a final question on the UK contract. Can you talk a little bit about the labor transfer that have occurred or will occur? And is there any restrictions on that? Like do you have union agreements, or do you have flexibility on workforce adjustments, or are your hands tied. If you could just go through that a little more? Thanks.\n",
      "Lou Von Thaer - President, National Security Sector, Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So, this is Lou again. So, we have the TUPE process in the UK that kind of regulates and determines how these items are happening and the abilities that people have. So we did a couple of things. One is we partnered with Kuehne + Nagel, a large logistics firm, worldwide firm that's been a terrific partner on this. And what we have done is Leidos will take over some of these employees, Kuehne + Nagel will take over many of them who are doing a lot of the distribution, truck driving, forklifts, things like that. And we will use what flexibilities we do have within the contract. The MOD expects the size of the workforce to come down over time as we add efficiencies. But by partnering with a large UK firm who has hundreds of job openings around the country for commercial versions of the same types of services, we believe the training programs we're putting in place and the flexibility they have with job openings will allow places for people to land as we add efficiencies to the contract and also to help the folks from the government side become trained in some commercial techniques in addition to the skills they already bring to the program.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So are you tied into some type of wage agreement or labor type – similar type of union agreement, for example, like we have in – like there might be in the U.S. in some circumstances?\n",
      "Lou Von Thaer - President, National Security Sector, Leidos Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean. There are the MOD – or the government rules across the UK and we are tied into those. Those are all factored into the bid that we put forward and within those rule sets are where we plan to add the efficiencies that we'll add over time.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just be clear on pass-throughs and commodities, so you are not – none of the equipment you're putting through is going to go through your revenues. That is why the margin on this program you're talking about is going to be – once it ramps up, is going to be similar to the NSS normalized margins. Is that correct? It's just going to be more just direct labor?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Exactly. That's our plan. And as Mark stated, we plan to use net accounting and through the ability that we're able to do that. That's exactly how we'll book the program.\n",
      "Bill R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Bill.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael French from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Michael Kendrick French - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.\n",
      "Michael Kendrick French - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Roger, you did mention on your portfolio shaping that you haven't made any decisions. The question would be, if you could please add a little color on the factors that are being evaluated and what we might anticipate in terms of the timing of any decisions.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. It's not a very exciting process. We're thinking about who the best natural owner is for the businesses that we have in light of where want to go from a strategy standpoint. And it became clear that Plainfield that we were not the best natural owner for a renewable power plant and it was a – not a difficult decision for the team nine months ago or so. CloudShield sort of ended up in the same mode very kind of hardware-driven product that we didn't think aligned with where we wanted to go. And I don't want to overstate that work that we're doing. We just want to make sure that we have a consistent strategy and the businesses that we have in our portfolio align with that strategy.\n",
      "Michael Kendrick French - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Okay. And I suppose the flip side on the portfolio shaping would be potential acquisitions. As I am sure you are very well aware, the marketplace has been heating up in this space recently. Wondering what your thoughts are on possibility of perhaps an acquisition.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We've touched on this in prior calls. Let me just kind of reiterate our thinking in our process. But first, obviously, we do recognize that there has been a considerable amount of activity in the mid-tier space and in the services sector. The deals that had happened, I think everyone has taken a look at. One would draw from that that we have as well, and we are not disappointed that those deals went to another company again. We're being very careful about our strategy and where we want to position the company. We currently have the ability to play in the marketplace, and we have a group and a pipeline, and we're looking at all of these opportunities, but as I said in the past I think we're being very thoughtful about where we're going to deploy our capital. And it would have to be a business that created considerable cross linkages into our business and the pricing would have to be right. Now is not the time for us to lose our discipline given that we have an enviable balance sheet position.\n",
      "Michael Kendrick French - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Okay, very well. Finally, I would just like to conclude my questions by just offering a comment. Mark, I would like to thank you for all your help and extend my best wishes for you in your future endeavors. Thanks again.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Michael, very much.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n",
      "Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC: Hi, this is Amit Singh for Jason. Just quickly on the guidance, now that one quarter for the year is behind us and there are still a couple of moving parts in the whole year. So I just wanted to get a sense of, as you've provided or reiterated your guidance, how much visibility do you have towards the lower end of the revenue guidance right now?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Let me make sure I understand the question. I think your question how much visibility do we have towards the lower end of our guidance.\n",
      "Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. Revenue guidance.\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'm sure as you heard Mark reaffirmed the guidance that we had out at the beginning of the year. So, our revenue guidance is $4.6 billion to $5.0 billion. And I think sort of what you're asking is how do we feel about our risk and opportunities given the guidance that we have out there, and I'll make a statement. I'll turn it over to Mike or to Mark excuse me. I mean clearly we have reaffirmed our guidance based upon the visibility that we have in the year given that we just closed the first quarter. So, we must feel pretty comfortable with the balance between our risk and opportunities and the guidance that we have outstanding. Mark if you want to add any color.\n",
      "Mark W. Sopp - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Amit, I'll just say that we have some upside opportunities, and we have some risks. But we think on balance even given a fair share of each of those, we can be in our range and comfortably in our range. And so I'd say we have good visibility and confidence clearly on the lower end and above that coming out of a strong quarter. We do have some security products that are backend weighted. Some of those are international. Those represent some degree of risk although we have a great team there. We've mentioned the visibility issues on our commercial health. We had confidence in the new team we have there, and then we have Plainfield which we do expect to sell. We factored that in for half of the year with operating losses. If that shifts to the right then that could apply a little bit of pressure there. And I'd say major upside is getting LCST off the ground not to the guidance, but to offset those possible risks to balance things out. So, we think we have a strong portfolio and we're off to a good start, so we're confident we'll hit the expectation.\n",
      "Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC: All right, perfect. Then in the prepared remarks you spoke about dividends being your top priority for capital deployment; and then you just talked about your M&A strategy. But where does share buyback fall into all of this? And what is your thinking about share buyback or any accelerated share buyback in near-term as you're (49:41) if you're looking for any opportunity or strong cash flow?\n",
      "Roger A. Krone - Chief Executive Officer: Right. Well, okay. So, share buyback is a tool that we have used in the past. We still have about 8 million shares authorized by the board. It is in that category of returning value to the shareholders and it's something that we consider every quarter as we think about our cash deployment.\n",
      "Amit Singh - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\n",
      "Kelly P. Hernandez - Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay. Thank you, all, so much for joining us today on the call. Thank you for your interest in the company. We look forward to updating you again next quarter. Thanks.\n",
      "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect.\n"

      "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the ManTech International Corp. First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Stuart Davis, Executive Vice President for Strategy. Sir, you may begin.\n",
      "Stuart Davis: Thank you, Amanda, and welcome, everyone. On today's call, we have George Pedersen, Chairman and CEO; Kevin Phillips, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Bill Varner and Dan Keefe, our two Group Presidents. During this call, we will make statements that do not address historical facts and thus are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.These forward-looking statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. For a full discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in our latest Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements made on this call. Now, I'd like to turn things over to George.\n",
      "George Pedersen: Good afternoon and thank you for participating in today's call. For the first quarter, ManTech showed strong margin driven by stability and direct labor and lower indirect expenses. We experienced some reduction in revenue which was the result of pullback and sub-contracts and materials primarily that was used in Afghanistan. The in-theatre staffing today is about 300 people compared to 2400 in early 2013. In addition we had excellent cash generation with operating cash flow more than doubled net income. Our ability to generate cash enables us to invest in the growth of the company. On that note earlier this week we acquired Welkin Associates which strengthens our ability to provide high end systems engineering and business solution especially in intelligence community. Welkin is the next organization to ManTech and we are actively looking for other promising acquisition candidates. The 44 million in cash and net cash and then $500 million line of credit we have cash and the balance sheet to acquire more and larger firms and we will refine the appropriate ones. The current industry dynamics support our acquisition plans given the greatest certainty around funding, we are seeing more high quality companies of all sizes become available for acquisition. In addition to full appropriation for the fiscal year 2015, there appears to be more normal appropriation, a more normal appropriation classes to 2016. The budget resolution pass and both the house of the senate. It is encouraging to see both houses of the Congress are looking for ways to increase defense spending whether to increase OCO funding that's overseas funding or sequester relief. We see funding in fact we see the funding environment as a very positive for the industry and for ManTech. Now Kevin will provide you details on our financial performance and outlook. Kevin?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Thank you George. Revenues for the first quarter were 370 million compared to 452 million in the first quarter of last year and 411 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The year over year revenue difference are mostly explained by clients in the Afghanistan related contracts and pressure is on the overall army budget. Revenues for the quarter were below last quarter as a result of two factors, first we experienced reduced sub-contract material requirements primarily from the army and OCO related demand. Annualized direct labor which is central to our value proposition as a services company was up compared to the fourth quarter after adjusting for two fewer workdays. Second, projected new contract awards did not materialized almost 2 billion of awards expected in the first half of this year have slipped to the right causing delays in the work. Our support for OCO contributed 23 million which is down 8 million from the first quarter. We still expect the OCO related work contributed about 75 million for the year. There is a little change in the standard revenue breakouts that we report. Prime contractor mix remained at 89% of revenue, 68% of first quarter revenues were on cost plus contracts, 11% were on time of material contracts and 21% were on fixed price contracts. Operating income for the quarter of 20 million was essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2014. Quarterly operating margin of 5.4 million increased a 100 basis points year-over-year, as a result of the direct labor mix, strong contract performance and improved cost management. General and administrative expenses dropped 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Net income was 12 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.31 for the quarter which were up 23% and 19% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2014. Net income and earnings per share benefitted from margin expansion as well as reduced interest expenses from redeeming senior notes of the second quarter of 2014. Onto the balance sheet and cash flow statement, during the quarter, cash flows from operations were 26 million or 2.2 times net income. DSOs were 87 days for the quarter which reflects the temporary increase as we upgraded the company’s financial management system. DSOs to come back down as we complete this transition. Our balance sheet at quarter end shows 44 million in cash and no debt after playing 7.9 million in dividend. Our balance sheet provides plenty of fire power for acquisitions such as the Welkin acquisition we just closed. The $34 million payment which we're able to fund from cash on hand will be reflected on our second quarter financials. Welkin contribute sold growth in operating margins and be accretive to earnings per share in 2015. Turning to business development, bookings for the quarter were $149 million for a book-to-bill of 0.4% times. As a result backlog at the end of the quarter stood at 3 billion of which 900 million was funded. Approximately 44% of awards were for new business, primarily in the areas of health, software support, and systems engineering. We also won $44 million contract in the quarter that was subsequently proto-testing. We continue to be optimistic at a significant number of proposal debt outstanding will be awarded during 2015. At the end of the quarter we had a total qualified pipeline of 21 billion of which 5 billion was outstanding and waiting - the total pipeline is over weighted for cyber, intelligence and health for those areas adding over 2 million in qualified opportunities over the last six months. Since the last call we have identified 2 billion in additional proposals that we expect to submit in 2015 for a total of nearly $9 billion. This will be about 2 billion more than last year which was more than doubled the volume of 2013 and a record for us excluding the overseas activity. Despite delays in protest the market is said to rebound and revenues will accelerate as we win work from substantial pipeline of submitted proposals or near-term opportunity. Now that the - we expect to revenues of 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion net income of 53.7, to 57.9 and diluted per share of a $1.43 or $1.54. The guidance reduction reflects slower than anticipated workflow and lower materials in sub-contracted volumes than previously expected. We have five proposal activity with continued uncertainty around the timing and outcome of award decisions. As a result we believe the guidance ranges are most appropriate at this point. Our revised revenue guidance assumes about 100 million of new business with future acquisitions. We believe this is reasonable given our substantial pipeline strong balance sheet and market environment that is turning more favorable. If customers stick their announced adjudication schedule which will be closer to the upper end to that range. On the bottom-line revised guidance shows an improved margin outlook from labor mix and lower G&A expense. Operating margin for the year should ended about 5.7%. Expectations or other items such as tax, rate and operating cash flow remain unchanged. Now Bill speak to our cyber and Intel business. Bill?\n",
      "Bill Varner: Thanks, Kevin and I am extremely pleased to welcome the highly skilled employees of Welkin to ManTech and to MCIS. They bring deep experience and demonstrated expertise and virtually all of them are directly supporting intelligence missions and are cleared at the highest level. Welkin deliveries mission centric services in high end systems engineering and advance national security technology and business services. Welkin's contributions to its customers are notable for their technical depth and for their criticality to mission execution. Their primary customer is the National Reconnaissance Office where they have performed work in nearly every directors in office supported dozens of major system acquisitions and aided in the operations of dozens more. In addition Welkin supports the number of other key customers both within the intelligence community and across the Department of Defense. Welkin's expertise is consistently sought by both customers and teaming partners. This acquisition is strategically positions us to pursue large engineering and support activities in the intelligence community and the Department of Defense. Together we are focused on the seamless transition of existing work and aggressive pursuit of new business. In other news I spent last week at the RSA conference which is the world's largest information security event. My discussions with existing and potential customers and partners highlighted the need for our cyber security services and product. The conference also showcased the momentum we are seeing on the commercial product side as we've rolled out the Linux addition of Responder Pro which analyzes physical memory from servers and hosts and enables deep forensic analysis of now artifacts in memory. Our product addressed the gap in today's market currently filled with signature and indicators of compromised based security products which are limited in their effectiveness and unable to defend against sophisticated event resistant threat. Our patented approach performed behavior based analysis of physical memory to detect malicious processes. With 200 plus customers and ManTech's deep cyber security experience in the Federal Government we delivered differentiated value and are poised for growth. In our services business, our customers are actively engaged and moving procurements alone. Many are still experiencing delays but we are seeing promising signs that our intelligence community customers will be making significant awards over the next several quarters. Our position in cyber should benefit from legislation that is currently working through Congress. After a series of false starts it appears that we will finally get cyber legislation that would push company to share access to their computer networks and records with federal investigators. Last week the house passed two bill that are similar to a measure approved by the senate intelligence committee. There are still some issues around the balance between privacy and liability protection but I'm hopeful that legislation will be enacted this year. Dan?\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Good afternoon. Like Bill I have just returned from major conference highlighting one of our key growth initiatives. Earlier this month they attended the health information and management system society or HIMS conference in Chicago. This event was massive and underscore how robust the health market will be for years to come. The conference also serves a launch of our ManTech health brand. Over the past three years we have invested in three acquisitions to build our capability and customer presence in health IT. Now we are aggressively investing and building out the leadership team to sustain and accelerate our growth. Our new leadership with Steve Comber, our new General Manager we've just hired three stellar executive that bring ManTech's health tremendous credibility and thought leadership. John Dorman joins us as Chief Information Officer responsible for the development of ManTech Health IT solution strategy and technology focused services to improve healthcare outcome. Dr. Bryan now leads our health and human services business and Dr. Carl Brazen [ph] will start next week as our Chief Medical Officer. All three are nationally recognized experts who have demonstrated ability to managing grow large federal health businesses. ManTech health will be a significant growth driver for MSS and ManTech. Turning to other parts of our business as Kevin indicated, we have stability in our OCO work. Over the last quarter we have received plus ups on some in-theatre work to maintain current levels of support. We do not see further downsize to our in-theatre business which provides us a stable platform for which to grow additional foreign military sales. However our business overseas is very much dependent on political decisions. George?\n",
      "George Pedersen: In summary, ManTech is moving out aggressively on acquisitions and new proposal submissions as we await awards from our large pipeline of submitted proposals. We are seeing a number of high quality companies coming to market and Welkin is the first of what we hope to be several additional acquisitions in 2015 and I started by the volume of opportunities that Bill and Dan are pursuing very high priority mission. In closing, I want to highlight to two region, accommodation speaks to the commitment and dedication of our employees and the work environment at ManTech. President Obama recognized ManTech employee with the Energy Lifestyle Award for developing a pioneer training program to health transition military residents to the clean energy workforce. In addition to military times recently rank ManTech is one of the best employees - we greatly value the contributions of our veterans, veterans have made and we're proud that so many of them are making another clear for themselves at ManTech. With that we are ready to take your questions.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good evening. It’s Rick on for Ed. Thank you for taking my question. The first one George you talked a lot of about M&A I was just curious sort of the size of the transactions you are looking or maybe the size of the transactions that we are comfortable with and whether you have seen larger properties now in the pipeline.\n",
      "George Pedersen: We have seen larger properties and I must say the volume of candidates that we are interested has increased in the past few months. For a period of time yeah, it was a little dry but it is turning around. And I will let Bill talk a little more about the acquisition that we have made but that is a good profile of what we are looking for. Talk a moment about why we picked what we did.\n",
      "Bill Varner: I will be happy to, thank you George. So the Welkin Associates acquisition is a represents opportunities for us in customer spaces that we know very well but market that are adjacent to where we are currently performing so, it provides us some opportunities to some current some large upcoming procurement where leader company could earn themselves but together we are able to and they offers us I think great expansion opportunities in areas where we are very interest in moving.\n",
      "George Pedersen: And again from the acquisition point of view we just reported our cash position. It is unusual for us over the years that have been - but we have been in that position for a while but we will continue to look aggressively for the companies large and small we will not by sales we must get new technology, new customers, new people and we have to be able to make a clear that is our policy in--\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Also just one the last point I believe you said Welkin would be accreted to 2015 EPS I am curious if you can give the expected run rate for revenue or maybe what the 2014 revenue was?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yeah, so 2014 revenue is about $33 million and the run-rate slightly above that on the day of acquisition and we will see growth from that going forward.\n",
      "George Pedersen: On that sales alone the combination.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just a last question for me you talked about seeing some awards not materializing things slipping to the right. I know that has been the trend for a while now from the space but curious what the recent behavior going to client it has been different and why do you think those in particular slot? Thank you.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yeah, so there is a lot of volume in customer and I'll let Dan and Bill add to it. There are a lot of customers working procurements I think the slots are mixed based on the customer but generally they have the money they are going to make awards which is different than two years think they're being very cautious about reviewing everything and making sure that it's a reasonable decisions on their behalf and then in some cases I think different agencies are still going through internal reviews as to prioritization. But we see a lot of volumes, we see a lot of opportunities we're very focused on that and I think it's more internal timing within the customer. Guys do you want to add anything? A - Bill Varner And in some cases in the intelligence community we see that there are just aren’t people in the acquisition workforce and therefore the review of proposal takes time and the awarding the proposals takes more than then it should.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.\n",
      "Steven Cahall: Yeah, thanks very much. Maybe just a first question on revenue and growth just you know looking for range and guidance for the year and maybe excluding the OTO work is it reasonable for us to expect you maybe exit the year with flat or even slightly growing revenues were based on the instability which you're still seeing would that be able to too optimistic at this point.\n",
      "Unidentified Corporate Speaker: So I mean that the timing of growth is very much depend on the contract award volume which we have not submits out there we do expect all things moving in the right direction in Q4 this year that will start seeing in the growth and we do expect that to the year based on the volume of activity that will start seeing a growth patter again.\n",
      "Steven Cahall: Okay and then maybe just to follow up the M&A theme. Maybe a couple of questions here. So George you mentioned that Welkin is a good example of some stuff you're seeing maybe - seeing that you could do a lot of things at the size of Welkin and still have a lot of cash left. Is there an appetite to do anything outside of the dividend or M&A or are we saving all of the cash for M&A in terms of priorities at this point.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Hey Kevin I'll speak with that. As we've been fairly consistent with the acquisitions is our number one priority. Dividend policy we firmly have a second. If we don't have any use of cash after looking at properties which I think are number out there that I just toward set are becoming more active and we look at other alternatives and we have discussion around that to make decisions. But the acquisitions continues to be our number one priority for use of cash.\n",
      "Steven Cahall: And then a final one from me and then I'll get off. When you talk about the M&A pipeline picking up and the interest picking up with the stabilization in the market. Does the same thing happen where all this said now you are getting interest as a target as well do you see that level of activity in the market or have that would be buyers of companies really not guiding that comfortable with the situation as yet.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: I think that the companies have to focus on that as a strategy and then they're being more open about that based upon the market be rather than more strategic discussions like that. That's our view.\n",
      "Steven Cahall: Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Kinstlinger with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Thank you I wanted to start with how many proposals are waiting awards into the March quarter.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: We have $5 billion proposals in process or are waiting award.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Okay and then from that I guess I understand there were delays. But as I look back to a very few quarters where you had this much just a little business from new awards. You had a few in '14 and in previous years I mean '13, '12 or if something like the $60 million to $65 million contract renewal awards or new revenue. Right so I guess I'm wondering if that’s a function of delay is getting worse. Are you is your win rate a little bit lower than in the past does it may be curious where you think behind the weaker bookings is opposed to the stronger bookings of course not March of last year which was one of the weakest quarters you ever had.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yeah so just couple of observations. For the announced proposals that we're going after a vast majority at 80% range of new work and that is going to be harder to get win rates or wins. And so that I guess in average historic the win rate is going to be less. But if we get those contract awards from the upside is significant. So we're very much focused on that that we compete levels this year below average and that the timing is to get depends on the customer set but generally we see more activity but more cost as review cycle to get to the award. And I think that they will begin to award is just the timing issue.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Okay hearing on the hill is that this current plans increase the defense budget by $38 billion for next year that is in a formal proposal at this point in time. But that's the current beliefs that that's how the appropriation process will wind up by adding $38 billion\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Now I know in April you would expected a few very large award which in second quarter to be adjudicated hoping that you'd be the victor as that's new business couple of large intel ones. Where those further delayed or has April started off the same way the first quarter started.\n",
      "Bill Varner: Well Brian this is Bill one of those large activities was mine and I'm sorry to have to say that unfortunately we were not awarded best large - despite providing a very compelling technical and management solutions. However we still have many large opportunities left within the intelligence community that we are either currently writing proposals awaiting award or in some phase of capture.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: We were not be - on that particular program so it doesn't represent the decline in our revenue. And there is still maybe opportunities for sub-contracts.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: But why committed all on that I think there one there was inconvenient and a multi 100 million to a billion dollar award is that one?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yes, Brian there was inconvenient.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Okay. And I guess I have one more question on the bigger picture of guidance I mean it is not just guys the industries had a difficult meeting as we have seen some contracting go down we have seen hardware or material purchases go down and we have seen protest and you mentioned in your guidance basically include a 100 million that you need to win or acquire first of all that is the low end of the midpoint but secondly given the pace of our words right now coupled with the protest usually will make you take a long time before you actually generate revenue is that really reasonable? I mean is that a difficult target of 100 million do you think that is challenging target I am just curious how you look at that?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: So when we look at the amount of new business award for going after and the 5 billion is actually actionable and I would mention the industry the biggest judge - if you have that amount of activities from the government you think you are well positioned how do you incorporate that into your view of the business and how much delayed you have built to the timing of the awards and we have time to come more focus on that timing and trying to build that in but I would say it is hitting this but we fit more than a share then we work then it goes above that and if not then we continue to wait for those awards to happen. The $100 million is the midpoint and again I think that we are well positioned based on the investments we have made over the last year and half if you start new business awards into that expansion.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: One last one, the second quarter revenue given the new awards not to recomplete we are fairly low it be similar looking to March quarter plus maybe the acquisition revenue that you have I mean there shouldn’t be a steep ramping like you are saying the second-half of the year hopefully will be much stronger given congress it was then how we should think about it?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It will be higher there are more billable mandates in second quarter then first, first quarter is a low spill of the mandate at the total year and we do expect some of the ODCs not all but some of the ODCs that did not occur inQ1 come back up because it is more of a timing issue and then in Dan’s - pace to start getting more new contract awards and in fact the first month’s contract award is already at or above our full prior quarter award subject to protest. So we --some another.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Great, thank you.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: And Brian we do expect Q3 to above Q2 and Q4 to above than Q3.\n",
      "Brian Kinstlinger: Got it, thanks very much.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Loomis from Stifel. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Okay, thank you. On the OCO revenue I heard 75 million for the year but what was for the quarter and first quarter?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: 23 million.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Okay. And then on 100 million of awards you mean but that include potential acquired companies or is that just new organic bids?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It is a mix if we have a bids that get awarded we can see getting to the upside of our range with that $100 million and then if not then we have an inquisitor process that could help us get there if the contract awards don’t happen. So we build them all them together but we do think there is not contract award activity to support the range that we have to be the primary driver.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Okay. And then on the commercial cyber Bill you talked about your new products 200 customer. What is the run rate on that now and is the commercial cyber profitable?\n",
      "Bill Varner: Commercial cyber is not yet profitable and that we are still investing in the business. We do have 200 commercial customers we have also several government commercial customers or the commercial products these are products that can be sold either to the government or to others in the industry is that what you are asking Bill?\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Yes, then anyway you can size what is the revenue run rate is now in commercial cyber?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It is Kevin it is consistent with prior but the level of investment is less we are actually closer to break even not breaking closer to than a year a fairly consistent top-line number.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: And if I have look back to nose was that 5 million in the quarter than in the past?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It was full year between $5 million and $10 million okay. And then on the OCO revenues to stabilizing and you have a good visibility on that $75 million. What happened as we extent 9000 troops for another year? Do you think you could actually see some potential growth in that or do you is this kind of the floor number?\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Yeah this is Dan as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we did see additional funding and that really to for the government recognized that the ramp down of their plan was not going to occur as they had planned it. So I don't see additional growth again that's all time the political decisions obviously. But I think what we're seeing is fairly stable given the national guidance for 2015 pretty stable for this year.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Okay. And then the margin on that OCO business is that still to only 4% or 5% type business.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: It's below that it's below under the range that we have for returns.\n",
      "Bill Loomis: Okay thank you.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Good afternoon.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Hello.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Hi, I guess I have a couple of questions which related to the revenue guidance just like others before me. Before we get to that one question what was your organic sales growth in the quarter and what's embedded for the year.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: For the quarter organic decline of 23% and for the full year midpoint the organic would be around 9%.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Okay about 9%. And then on the --.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Negative sorry yes.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Minus 9. I'm hearing what you're seeing about the pipeline. But at the same time I can't help at noticed that your funded backlog is added just relative low here at around $900 million total backlog as well. And at the midpoint of your guidance which of course includes it sounds like some business you have in one. The implied quarterly revenue is a good $50 million above what it was in the first quarter. And so I'm just struggling to see how we don't continue to see how we get to the guidance number the revenue number. Because when we knock off the $100 million we knock off the three quarter contribution from the acquisitions. I guess you should be somewhere in the $1.5 billion range. So it's not clear to me quite how you get there how you have the confidence to get there.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Okay. So in the first quarter if you think about the revenues that we have there. About half of that roughly $20 million of that is related to OCO drops or mandate differences the mandate differences will come back up. And the other half were on the ODCs that we do believe based on the visibility that will come back at some level let's say $10 million. So roughly $20 million on top of the three 370 gets us moving in the right direction. We do have contract awards are starting to get. And the $900 million we have in funded backlog is fairly consistent with last year. And the majority of the work that we're bidding on is new. So we do think that if we start getting contract awards it will be new business this will start ramping up and should get us to the guidance range that we’ve provided.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Would you say Kevin that you've changed maybe this question for George as well? You’ve changed your forecasting process at all through over the past several quarters given the challenge to meet projections?\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Yes I think we have changed that we've also tried to work towards the range based on what we have. So, we are trying to modify what we are providing moving to the ranges looking at what we have based on just the variability of having –so many proposals outstanding, but the timing of the awards being uncertain.\n",
      "George Pedersen: We are trying to tie the current status to the appropriation process. It's frustrating to have so many proposals submitted and awaiting award and they're not coming to the system. And it's hopeful that we hope at this point in time that this additional funding and the additional staffing will accelerate that process.\n",
      "Stuart Davis: This is Stuart we're also trying to be very transparent about what we need to hit that guidance.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: I think you are being as transparent as you can be but it is just been a trend here where somehow the numbers have been somewhat consistently optimistic, relatively to what’s come through and I am just wondering if there is any kind of systemic explanation.\n",
      "George Pedersen: It's based on the timing of awards and if we are being [indiscernible] about the new business getting our fair share of it and that would be our downside.\n",
      "Robert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Hey good evening guys.\n",
      "George Pedersen: Hey.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Maybe I missed this but could you articulate Welkin’s contribution to the sales this year and to earnings?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: So the earnings are small given the size of the deal, it's a $33 million revenue business in 2014, we expect it to, from the date of contract award for to be at or above that run rate, totally in the mid-20s to the low 20s in terms of contribution --.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Alright and you said its de minimus earnings maybe $0.01 or $0.02?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yes.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Okay and then you mentioned I think Kevin that early in the second quarter you have had a pretty good contract award pace and I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that. How does it?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It's more normalized to where we want to be, I wouldn’t say it's robust but it's moving in the right direction.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Okay and to hit… I mean just go back to this question on the sales guidance, specifically how much go-get do you still have and do you need to book to hit the numbers, to hit the low end and maybe to hit the high end?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: So the $100 million is the revenue contribution we need from new business awards and the go get totally depends on what the time of those contract awards are. So if we have $5 billion or $8 billion we expect to be awarded over the next 12 months, the timing of those awards and how much we get is what’s going to drive that.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Okay. Just to be clear on those stuff, that’s a 100 million of awards from today, so not including what you’ve already won in the quarter?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Correct, $100 million.\n",
      "George Pedersen: $100 million in revenue that’s driven by new awards at the midpoint of the guidance.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Got it, of revenue so the award will have to be much higher presumably.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yes.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: And could you comment on with respect to what you are bidding on, does it come with a lot of sub contract and/or ODC works so that I imagine it would be very difficult to hire and ask people to convert 100 million of direct billable labor into sales in the year, or not? I mean if you could just… Are there any chunky bids that you are pursuing, are you doing a lot of ODCs with them?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: It's mainly services based and there will be mix of ManTech labor and sub contract labor. There are some ODCs but as not as heavily weighted or merely as heavily weighted as it was in the past.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Okay, in the 100 million you have talked about, is that to get to the low end of the range, or is that the midpoint of the range?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: That’s where we have what we have as midpoint.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.\n",
      "Operator: [Operators Instructions] Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Thanks I was wondering if you could talk about the healthcare end market and what you are seeing there both on the government side in any kind of commercial prospects you may have? Thank you.\n",
      "Dan Keefe: Yes, this is Dan. I mean clearly within the government health market, which is where our focus area is, there is tremendous effort going on the government to standardize the electronic health records and that’s what we do, both in data analysis, cloud based health records, so you see that in all the agencies, the DoD Defense health agency, NVA and Health of Human Services. So that’s really where the large growth within that business that we see, commercially limited right now.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Right, switching gears just one kind of tech question, the temporary pick up in DSO pardon us if you mentioned this, because I did juggle on the couple of calls, has that righted itself so far in 2Q or do you expect it too soon?\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yes, we expect it to write itself it's a conversion issue we upgrade our system, our financial system, it’ll correct itself over the quarter.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Okay, so from your perspective just the temporary blip almost behind us.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Yes.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Okay. From a balance sheet perspective I understand you were pretty constructive on M&A opportunities are there any other plans to return capital to shareholders, kind of above and beyond the dividend that you have got and the capital structure perhaps could be enhanced? Thanks.\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: Sure. Right now we still have to use cash primarily for acquisitions, as they review the dividend policy every quarter, at this point in time we are maintained at our current dividend level. But if we don’t see any path for acquisition that are adventurous to us, it will go back to yard again.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Is there any kind of longer term capital structure goal that you would have in mind I understand it can be kind of chunky and you can oscillate around it depending on acquisitions you may consummate but…\n",
      "Kevin Phillips: I think what we have found is that… the dividend distribution that we have seems to fit within our operating cash flow the desire of we want to maintain additional acquisitions I don’t see that profile changing in the near future.\n",
      "Tobey Sommer: Okay. Thank you very much.\n",
      "George Pedersen: Amanda it appears that we have no more questions in the queue at this time. I appreciate your help on the call. As usual members of the team will be here available for follow-up questions. So I thank you all for your participation on today’s call and your interest in ManTech.\n",
      "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.\n"

I’d now like to turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen:  Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco’s second quarter results for fiscal year 2012 and the press release issued earlier this morning.  With me today are Tyco’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen; and Tyco’s Chief Financial Officer, Frank Sklarsky. Also joining us for today’s conference call are the President’s of Fire and Security, ADT and Flow Control. George Oliver, Naren Gursahaney, and Patrick Decker, who will provide updates on their businesses and also participate in the Q&A sessions following our remarks.  I would like to remind you that during the course of today’s call we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today’s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we’ve included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com. Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC Form 10-Q later today. Certain items to be discussed during today’s call, including those related to the company’s proposed separation, will be addressed in a proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Before making any voting decisions, investors are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the proposed separation and any other relevant documents carefully in their entirety as they become available, because they will contain important information about the proposed separation.  Free copies of the proxy statement when available and other documents filed with the SEC by Tyco can be obtained through the SEC’s website, as well as through Tyco’s website. I would also like to remind you that we recently filed a Form 10 registration statement related to the ADT Corporation and posted a slide deck related to the Form 10 to our website. We also intend to file documents with the SEC, related to the Flow Control and chair merger and the Tyco shareholder votes related to the transaction within the next week. Due to the SEC filing process, we are restricted in what we can say with respect to the transactions and therefore ask that you limit your questions during to Q&A session to those related to our quarterly results.  In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in average revenue per user, backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to our operating margins during the call exclude special items and these metrics are non-GAAP measures. Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release. Now, let me quickly recap this quarter’s results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.4 billion increased 9% year-over-year with organic revenue growth of 7%, nicely ahead of our previous guidance. Foreign currency negatively impacted revenue by less than 1% and acquisitions added three percentage points to our overall year-over-year revenue growth.  Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.71 and included charges of $0.15 related to special items. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.86. Now, let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments.\n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Antonella and good morning everyone. Our second quarter performance was highlighted by strong organic revenue growth. Order momentum over the last few quarters, coupled with continued growth in our ADT Residential business continues to drive higher top line growth. Our large and stable base of recovering and service revenue, which represented 45% of our revenue in the quarter, coupled with strong operating leverage led by the Fire and Security manufacturing businesses drove the operating performance of this quarter.  Additionally the benefit from our restructuring and cost containment initiatives helped fund additional investments across our businesses. Overall, operating income before special items increased 15% and earnings per share before special items increased 18% year-over-year. From an orders perspective, we saw continued acceleration from the 8% year-over-year order growth we saw in the first quarter, to 13% growth in the quarter we just exited, with 9.5% growth in Fire and Security and 21% growth in Flow Control. Our order activity combined with continued growth in our backlog puts us on track for even better operating performance in our seasonally stronger second half.  Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for each of the businesses. Starting with the new Fire and Security segment, the combined portfolio provides the nice mix of service, installation and product offerings. Top line growth in the quarter benefited from both an acceleration in organic growth, as well as the contribution from the various bolt-on acquisitions we recently completed.  Our operating performance in the quarter was strong. Operating income grew twice as fast as revenue, resulting in a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin year-over-year.  In ADT, recurring revenue, which represents almost 90% of ADT’s total revenue continued to growth with a nice increase in both the account base and average revenue per user.  In Flow Control, the ramp up in orders over the past few quarters has translated into solid organic revenue growth. We have been booking some large orders in border, which positively impacted our order rates this quarter. This keeps us on track to achieve at 14% operating margin for the fourth quarter.  With that, let me turn it over to George for some more detailed revenue of Fire and Security. \n",
      "George Oliver : Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Before I walk you through our results for the quarter, I would like to tell you about the new Fire and Securities segment. We are a leading global provider of Fire and Security products and services. We serve a variety of markets worldwide, including commercial, industry and retail, as well as residential markets outside of North America to name a few.  Our global market leading position and broad portfolio of products and services is supported by our highly trained worldwide sales force of 7,000 people, market leading brands and innovative technologies. These factors differentiate us from our competitors and it is these strengths that we plan to continue to leverage as we move forward.  Our broad portfolio of products and services allows us to partner with our customers, to help them meet their needs ranging from product design, manufacture and insulation, to maintenance and upgrades. On this systems install and services side, we design, sell and install service and monitor electronic security systems, as well as fire detection and suppression products across the glob.  The combined mix if our products with our worldwide sales, service and instillation footprint is unmatched in the Fire and Security industry. By leveraging our global reach, we plan to continue to take advantage of our ability to provide best-in-class integrated solutions to our diverse customer base.  Our product businesses design, manufacture and sell fire protection, electronic security and life safety products, including fire suppression, intrusion security, access control, anti-theft and video management systems.  Our products are sold directly to customers, as well as through our extensive global network of distributors. We are a technology leader in our industry. Innovation and new product development are critical to our success, its something that our customers expect.  As a result, this is an area that has been and will continue to be a primary focus as we stay ahead of the technology curve through organic investment in our R&D centers, while strengthening our portfolio with a disciplined acquisition process.  In fact, we had a number of very nice strategic bolt-on acquisitions that we completed this past quarter. These investments expand our presence in key high growth markets and developed countries, as well as strengthen our product portfolio and service offerings in key vertical markets.  As an example, this past quarter we acquired a majority of ownership state in Reliance, which is a leading fire protection solutions provider in China. We expect the addition of Reliance’s expertise in fire insulation, as well as their service business will further strengthen our presence in China, and allow us to expand our foot print, customer base and systems installation and service opportunities in the region.  In addition to an attractive portfolio, the Fire and Security business has a very nice cash conversion profile and an attractive return on investment. Our goal is to build upon the solid foundation we have today, but increasing our mix of higher margin service revenue, growing our presence in high growth markets, strengthening our product leadership by driving technology and to provide innovative customer solutions in insuring that we are operate with an efficient cost structure.  Now, let me turn to our results for the second quarter. Overall revenue for the quarter of $2.6 billion increased 5% year-over-year. Organic revenue grew 3.5% with acquisitions adding an additional three percentage points in foreign currency, exchange rates decreasing revenue by a modest 1%.  Focusing on the performance of our global installation service and product businesses, let me start with our global service platform, which is the largest portion of the portfolio. Service revenue represented about 45% of our revenue in the quarter and grew 3% organically year-over-year, with growth in all geographic regions.  Systems installation revenue which represented about 35% of total revenue in the quarter, declined 1% on an organic basis, as growth in Asia Pacific was more than offset by declines in North America and AMEA, due to the softness in the non-residential construction market.  The remaining portion of fire and securities revenues come from our product businesses, which represented about 20% of our revenue this quarter. Organic revenue grew 14% as we continue to experience strong demand across fire protection products, life safety and security products. From a profit perspective, operating income before special items was $309 million and the year-over-year operating margin improved 70 basis points to 12.1%. Growth of our higher margin service revenue increased volume leverage in the product businesses and the continued positive impact of restructuring the cost containment initiatives drove the improvement.  Year-over-year total orders grew 9.5% with service up 6%, systems installed up 3% and products higher by 33%. Backlog of $4.7 billion increased 5% on a quarter and sequential basis. Old orders and backlog exclude the impact of foreign currency, but include the impact of recent acquisitions.  Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect continued strong performance in fire and security, with total revenue of approximately $2.7 billion and 4.5% organic revenue increase over the prior year.  From an operating income perspective, we expect the operating margin to improve 30 basis points year-over-year, as we leverage the increased revenue and continue to benefit from our productivity initiatives.  Before I pass it over to Naren, I’d like to thank the Fire and Security team for their continued dedication and successfully operating the business and delivering another solid quarter. I am very pleased with the team’s ability to continue to deliver solid results or making great progress in bringing the new Fire and Security organizations together. Now, let me turn it over to Naren.\n",
      "Naren Gursahaney: Thanks George and good morning everyone. Before I walk you through our results for the quarter, I’ll first provide some background on the ADT segment. Today ADT is the leader in the $12.5 billion residential and small business security market. With over 6.4 million customers in North America, we estimate ADTs market share at 25%, a position that makes us several times larger than the next biggest competitor.  The residential and small business security market has proven to be very resilient as industry data shows continued expansion, even through the recent economic downturn. However, we estimate that only about 20% of U.S. households have monitored security system today. In comparison, 65% of homes have broadband services, 85% have paid television services, primarily cable and satellite and 97% of households have wireless. So as successful as we’ve been, four out of five households remain potential new customers. ADTs leadership position is driven by the most prominent brand in the residential security industry. A network of six fully redundant euro certified, company owned and operated monitoring centers. More than 200 field locations across the U.S. and Canada and more than 16,000 trained security professionals. We are also supported by the industry’s largest dealer network, which now consists of over 400 ADT authorized dealers, who are exclusive to us in the security space.  With over 135 years in the industry, security is not just one of ADTs offerings, it is what we do. With the introduction of ADT Pulse about 18 months ago, we have expanded our offerings from traditional security to interactive home and small business security solutions. Pulse enables our customers to remotely arm and disarm their security system from their Smartphones and other web enabled devices and/or receive notification about events that occur on their premises.  Our new offerings also extend beyond security to home and small business automation, climate and light control and remote video monitoring, all of which can be tailored to an individual customer’s needs. Pulse has quickly become an important part of our portfolio and we continually look to add new features and capabilities. We built the greatest subscriber base business, with close to 90% of our revenue recurring, driving strong returns and steady cash flows. Our focus is one creating shareholder value by managing client key levers, growing our customer base, optimizing the cost of bringing on new customers, increasing the revenue we received from customers each month, lowering the cost of service delivery and lengthening the time our customers stay with us. We continuously work to balance these value drivers to optimize our returns.  Now, let me turn to our results for the second quarter. Revenue during the quarter was $807 million, an increase of 5% over the second quarter of last year. We achieved recurring revenue organic growth of 5%, which was driven by a 3.5% growth in Average Revenue Per User or ARPU and nearly 2% growth in our customer accounts.  Pulse continued it’s strong momentum with a take rate of just over 35% in our direct channel during the quarter. This compares to the 28% take rate we saw in the first quarter. We are also seeing nice improvements in the Pulse take rate in our small business channel, where the take rate has improved to 19% versus the low teens last quarter, and as Ed mentioned on the call in January, we began the initial roll out of pulse to our authorized dealers this quarter and expect our take rates to pick up in this channel as well.  ARPU was $37.98 for the quarter. As I previously mentioned, this represents a 3.5% improvement year-over-year. Revenue per user on new accounts, which was primarily influenced by the Pulse take rates was up 5% year-over-year to $44.50. Our annualized attrition rate was 13.2% for the quarter, which is flattened year-over-year, but modestly up 20 basis points sequentially. During the quarter we made the decision to accelerate our planned price escalations. The increased number of escalations in the quarter resulted in a modestly higher number of disconnects; however, this rate was consistent with what we’ve seen with price increases in the past. Operating income before special items was $199 million and the operating margin was 24.7%, both of which were in line with our expectations. The operating margin was down 40 basis points year-over-year as we continue to invest to grow our business. To put this into context, we’ve added more than 300 sales reps over the past 12 months, representing a 9% increase in our field sales force. To support this growth, we also increased our advertising expense and other lead generation activities. As a result our sales and marketing costs were up 14% year-over-year.  While new sales reps generally take some time to ramp up their productivity, unit sales increased 90% year-over-year and we are confident this investment will continue to pay off going forward. At the same time we continue to be disciplined on our cost structure and a reduced G&A as a percent of revenue by 15 basis points year-over-year.  As we look to the third quarter, for recurring revenue, which represents 90% of our business, we expect organic growth to be consistent with what we saw in the second quarter in the 4% to 5% range. For non-recurring revenue, which represents the remaining 10% of the business, we anticipate a slight headwind as we are planning to begin that change in the ownership model for our Pulse equipment sales.  Historically about 30% of our system sold through our direct channel have been customer owned. As the Pulse systems include proprietary technology, it’s important for ADT to retain ownership of these assets. From a reported revenue perspective, the shift to more ADT owned systems will have a short term negative impact as revenue will be recognized over the life of the customer relationship rather than upfront. Keep in mind that the non-recurring revenues, which include these equipment sales, represent less than 10% of our total revenues.  From an operating income perspective, this change will provide a slight tailwind as the investment is also amortized over the life of the customer relationship, rather than being fully recognized at the time of sale.  On a cash return basis, which is really the important way to evaluate a subscriber business like ADT’s, this change has virtually no impact on our economics. So for the third quarter we expect recurring revenue to continue to grow in the 4% to 5% range and non-recurring revenue to decline about 7% organically, again due to the Pulse ownership change.  Overall, this is expected to result in year-over-year segment organic loan of approximately 3.5% for the third quarter. Our operating margin is likely to be in line with what we saw in the second quarter at about 25%. Now, let me turn things over to Patrick.\n",
      "Patrick Decker: Thanks Naren. Good morning everyone. As I provided an overview of Flow Control on the last quarters call, I’ll jump right into the quarter’s results. Overall revenue was $996 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year with 21% organic revenue growth. The revenue increase in the quarter was driven by strong growth in all three platforms.  In valve controls revenue grew 18% organically in the quarter, led by the oil and gas process industries. Incremental volume in this business continues to produce good year-over-year operating leverage.  Orders growth in the quarter remained strong with a 20% increase year-over-year, fueled by growth across the mining, oil and gas and process industries. We are in the part of the cycle where incoming orders are still outpacing outgoing shipments, so backlog continued to grow and we expect revenue to continue to grow in the second half of the year. In thermal controls, top line growth was boosted by the acceleration of installation work to complete a major capital project that began last year, contributing to the year-over-year organic growth of 32%. Although total revenue was better than we expected, the unseasonably warm winter in North America led to lower product sales, which carry a higher margin.  Organic revenue growth in water was 21% as a result of some new projects coming on-line and an easy compare with the prior year quarter. We continue to expect revenues in our operating margins and water to improve during the second half of fiscal 2012, as double digit order growth over the last two quarters continues to convert into revenue.  Overall total flow control orders in the quarter increased 21% year-over-year, our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit orders growth, so backlog of $1.9 billion increased 4% on a quarter sequential basis. Operating income before special items was $114 million and the operating margin was 11.4%. The impact of the year-over-year increase in revenue was partially offset by mix in thermal controls related to the warm winter impact on product sales, as well as $4 million of cost associated with the legacy project in water that we retained from a prior divestiture. We estimate that these two items negatively impacted our operating income by about $10 million and our operating margin by 100 basis points year-over-year. As we move into the second half of the year, we remain confident that significantly improving conditions in water, coupled with converting our order book in valves will drive improved operating margin performance. Specifically in the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase 12% year-over-year to about $1.4 billion with organic revenue growth in the low teens. We expect the operating margin to approach 13% in the third quarter, keeping us on a path to an operating margin of 14% for the fourth quarter. Now, I’ll turn things over to Frank.\n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: Thanks Patrick and good morning everyone. Let me quickly touch on a few other important items. First, our cash position and overall balance sheet remains strong. In the quarter we generated free cash flow of $326 million, which included $76 million of cash paid for special items, primarily related to restructuring and separation activities.  Adjusted free cash flow was $402 million. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow of $415 million increased to 21% year-over-year. We continue to invest in the future growth of our businesses and as a result we increased our capital expenditures and dealers spend by about $130 million year-to-date and this is reflected in the free cash flow results. Additionally as we previously disclosed, during the month of January we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $100 million. We were restricted for much of the quarter in our share buyback program, due to the pending announcement of the merger of our flow control business with Pentair. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and we expect to resume share repurchase activity during the third fiscal quarter. Next, corporate expense before special items was $75 million in the second quarter, which was favorable against our original estimates, partly due to the timing of project spend. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect corporate expense to increase to approximately $95 million to $100 million. Keep in mind that we traditionally see an up-tick in corporate expense in the second half of the year due to the timing of many of our annual actuary evaluations.  Given the year-to-date favor ability in corporate expense and the fact that we continue to make progress in reducing structural corporate expense with ongoing cost containment initiatives, we now expect corporate expense for the full year, before special items to be approximately $360 million, which compares to our original estimate of $390 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter before the impact of special items was 17.2% and we expect the tax rate in the third quarter to be approximately 18%. We continue to expect a 19% to 20% effective rate for the full year. Now, let me turn things back over to Ed to wrap up this morning’s call.\n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Frank. Before we open up the lines for questions, I want to spend a few minutes for our overall guidance for the third quarter and the full year.  We expect revenue for the third quarter to increase just above $4.5 billion. In terms of bottom line results, we expect to see a nice sequential improvement in our third quarter operating results in all three businesses, given recent order rates and improving business conditions and the flows water business. This operational improvement in fire and security, ADT and flow control is expected to contribute $0.11 of earnings on a quarter sequential basis.  As Frank mentioned, we expect the sequential increase in corporate expense to $95 million to $100 million in the third quarter, which compares to $75 million in the second quarter, which is expected to cost us about $0.05 per share on a quarter sequential basis.  When combined, these items result in a net increase of about $0.06 per share on a quarter sequential basis. With an expected average share count of about 470 million shares, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the third quarter to be about $0.92. Based on our year-to-date performance and our guidance for the third quarter, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance to approximately $3.65 compared to our previous guidance of $3.55 to $3.60 per share. Our full year guidance incorporates a share count of approximately 470 million. Lastly I want to thank our teams around the world for their effort in delivering another strong quarter, while at the same time preparing for the separation.  Thanks for joining us on the call and operator, if we can open up the line for any questions.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n",
      "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\n",
      "Ed Breen: Good morning Jeff.\n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: Good morning.\n",
      "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research:  Since we have Naren on the line, a couple of questions for him if I could. Just first on Pulse, two thoughts there Naren; first, it’s not that you scored willing enough to the dealers. Any initial color on the take rate there or their attitude to sell it and install it.  And also I was kind of wondering, you made the comments about evolving this in home automation and other things. What is your capability to go back and resell and up-sell the Pulse customer. We’ve always heard the dialogue that it’s kind of tough to go back and sell Pulse to the legacy customer, but via this set up, in the sense that you can actually dial up the features that have Pulse, kind of after sale down the road.\n",
      "Naren Gursahaney: Okay, well Jeff, let me start with the first question about Pulse with the dealers. Our real focus during the second quarter was with our largest dealer. We’ve been working very closely with them to make sure that the sales installation and provisioning processes work smoothly.  As I mentioned in the past, this is a very different product configuration for them, it’s a very different sales process for them and a very different install and we are working very closely with them to make sure they get the benefit of the lessons learned when we roll this out through our direct channel and even in our direct channel, we focused on our custom home channel first, because they were more used to selling and installing the more complex systems.  So we’ve got a lot of work to do with our dealers, but they seem very excited by the product and they are very interested in doing it, so I expect that we will see a ramp up, but I think it will be a slow ramp up and we are going to be very methodical to make sure that we do it right and really manage that customer experience, where every customer experience is good one, so I’d expect a slow methodical ramp up. Right now it’s probably only about 1% of our dealers via direct sales at this time. So it will be a ramp up as we move through this year and into next year. On the second question about taking upgrades out to our existing Pulse customers, actually that will be, yes, will continue to be a big opportunity for us. One is Pulse is very much of a software driven solution, so new capabilities we can push out to our customers, so that they have access to it immediately. In fact, we’ve already pushed out new upgrades to the software that’s out there.  And then as we bring on new hardware into the ecosystem, customers will have the opportunity to buy that hardware from us or go to traditional retail outlets to buy three way enabled devices that they’ll be able to install in their home, enroll into their Pulse system, very much in the same way you add a peripheral to your PC today.  So it should be a very easy install for them depending on the specific hardware and then again, very easy to enroll it in the Pulse system and be able to use it. We are testing new products all the time in our labs, developing the software for it and then the new software we push out, it’s already enabled in there.\n",
      "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: I was wondering on the accounting change on equipment, is that only related to Pulse accounts and is there any change in amortization rates or any other accounting changes for the Pulse specifically, relative to how you’ve been treating accounts historically.\n",
      "Naren Gursahaney: I would say it’s primarily focused on the Pulse equipment, because of the intellectual property there and there is no changes at all from an accounting perspective. Again, it’s juts whether we treat them as ADT owned or customer owned, so the accounting, the attrition curves, everything remains the same. \n",
      "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: And then just off for a header Frank and then I’ll jump off. Share count of 470 is actually drifting a little north from where you’re at. Could you just provide some color on why that is and you kind of how – I guess sounds like your not really stepping at the share repurchase in a meaningful way, so you’ve got some creep playing into the back half. Is that the way to think about it?\n",
      "Ed Breen: Well, there’s always some adjustment that takes place in the share account as a result of exercise activity and so on, but we will be back in the market during the third quarter, with sure activity and that will be bring the share count below what it would have been had we not been in the market. So we are at 469 at the end of Q2, 470 is where we think we are going to be as an assumption of the combination of the reverse activity and any other activity including exercise activity. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen: Jeff, its just the timing of the buybacks as we were at the market for the last couple of months because of the flow control Pentair transaction. So things kind of got pushed into the second half of the year. \n",
      "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research: All right, great. Thank you. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Jeff. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Your line is open. \n",
      "Scott Davis – Barclays: Hi, good morning guys. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Hey Scott. \n",
      "Scott Davis - Barclays: Naren, I just want to follow-up on Jeff’s question, because I think it’s interesting. The whole thought of protecting your intellectual prosperity, I mean is this essentially so that after the three-year contract runs out that somebody can shop around to get their party monitoring services and use your equipment in that process. Is that kind of the thought process here? \n",
      "Naren Gursahaney : For me that’s clearly a piece of it. We’ll have ownership or those assets, so there could be some restriction there. But again with the amount of intellectual property, I mean the traditional security system was generally off the shelf type of equipment, no real new intellectual property in there, kind of pretty standard stuff that’s been out there. With Pulse we made a significant investment in that technology; we want to make sure that we have adequate control over it. \n",
      "Scott Davis - Barclays: Yes, no it makes sense. Naren, I wanted to talk a little bit about Brink's and just do a little bit of a look back. I know you don’t consider Brink's as a segment or anything else all integrated, but there was some kind of angst when you did the deal that you might loose some sales folks and accounts. I mean can you give us a sense of a postmortem after the deal of kind of what percentage of the sales guys you are able to keep and what percentage of the accounts you are able to keep and just give us a sense of how that deal’s worked our so far. \n",
      "Naren Gursahaney :   Well, I think it still Scott has been very good deal for us, from the synergies we promised and we committed, we delivered, all of those. The integration I’d say is virtually complete. We still have some kind of backend IT systems that need to be finished from an integration perspective and we have pushed that out a little bit, because some of the work, IT work we have to do to support separation. But operationally everything, there is full integration there.  From a talent perspective, I’d say on the sales side we were able to retain the people there and they continue to be very active members, not just in the sales force, but of our management team and our leadership teams throughout the organization. We did loose a few people, some branch level General Mangers and that was really just because of the difference we have in structure.  We have a sales structure and an operation structure that operate integrated, but separate. So there weren’t as many General Manger roles. We lost a dew people there. We kind of knew that that was going to happen and from an account perspective, we’ve been able to retain those accounts and again it’s an integral part of our customer base. \n",
      "Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay and just a quick follow-up. How much into your accounts did you purchase in the quarter. \n",
      "Naren Gursahaney :   Our growth in dealer accounts was about 9%, same as the growth we saw in the direct side. \n",
      "Scott Davis - Barclays: So what is the dollar value of that, or… \n",
      "Naren Gursahaney : I don’t have that off hand, but we can get back to you with that. \n",
      "Scott Davis - Barclays: Okay, okay, thanks guys. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Scott. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Good morning.\n",
      "Ed Breen : Good morning Steve. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Let me just lead with the first question on separation cost, $98 million year-to-date. How are you tracking as you think about sort of that bigger, much bigger $700 million I think that you put out there for the full year. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Yes, we are still tracked in to that number, more than $50 million of it as we rolled it up recently. Remember in there is some restructuring numbers in addition to the other restructuring that we announced of about $125 million to $150 million. So we are tracked in to it, but a lot of hits in the very back half of the year. \n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: I don’t know if you’re going to add to that, the reason it hits the back half is primarily because of some of the debt refinancing. When we see, the majority of that spend its going to be in the summer time frame when we go though all that activity, so we are on track. \n",
      "Ed Breen: The debt refinance, frankly that is the single biggest piece by far on a percentage basis and the good news with that is there is some payback on that, because of the rates we’ll get on the refinancing. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: I was going to say that might look even better than when you first started talking about it right. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Yes, it’s slightly better hopefully. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, secondly, a lot of good thing to talk about, but let me just ask about the systems installation decrease, that 1%. George, just may be give me a sense, you talked about soft non-res construction markets versus prior year, but as I recall a year ago, it wasn’t a lot better from an end market perspective. Maybe just give a little color for what you see going on. \n",
      "George Oliver : I mean we are driven. When you look at the key metrics that drive that segments of our businesses, its really, the lead indicator is the architectural billing index and that has just been just slightly favorable over the last few quarters and so we are seeing that in the market, and so as we’ve said in previous quarters that we continue to be very selective with the projects that we do take on, certainly with the focus on the projects that drive recurring revenue and service, and so when you look at that we continue to win lower volume, continue to expand our margins and making sure that we are positioned from a resource standpoint to be able to grow our service revenue. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, so it sounds like your positive there as you look forward. \n",
      "George Oliver : In the quarter we are down about 1% on the installed side, but going forward I mean as we look at our orders, our orders are improving slightly in that space. Certainly we’ve been very aggressive on the service growth and that’s beginning to accelerate also. But when you look at the key indices that drive the market as far as products and square footage, the forecast is not for any significant increase going forward. And so we are not banking on a lot of volume there, we are going to continue to be selective and we think certainly that does create the installed base and helps us drive the recurring revenue and the service revenue. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein:   Great and then finally, Ed and Naren, I keep asking every quarter about the cable company response and their beta tests and they are rolling it out. Are you seeing or just once again I want to understand on both pricing and on share in any way, are you guys seeing any king of impact in any of the cities where your co-located with where they have aggressive efforts. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Yes, note Steve that the cable guys have rolled out some additional markets. I think you might have saw some announcements from them. But when you look at the metrics and the range team tracks them by market, we look at them, I guess Naren looks at them even more than I do I’m sure, but there is no change in any of our metrics in those markets and it think we are feeling very good competitively.  Cable guys have now been some markets for almost 18 months like we have, it’s a pretty decent amount of time to have some tack record and there really is no change in metrics whether its pricing, discount, anything there and with us now rolling out with the dealer networks which will be another almost 4,000 sales people over time, again its going to take time as Naren said, another 4,000 people marketing it, I think we are in a nice position over the next couple of years.\n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: And Naren would you add anything in terms of where your guys are going head to head with the cable guys and coming back with any kind of storage or anecdotes or is there any kind of color here about why you are winning, you’re not getting impacted.\n",
      "Ed Breen: Well again it’s head-to-head, but kind of a different scenario. Most of them are selling over the phone where we are selling face-to-face, so we are not necessarily head-to-head in the house. But I think our guys still feel very good about the offering we have out there, they feel very good about the reputation we have out there for service.  Clearly we are seeing other competitors be aggressive with their pricing, but I think also people understand promotional pricing has always been aggressive in that industry and I think there are a lot of people who are waiting to see what happens to those prices over the long term. I think especially those who know ADT or have been with ADT for years know that we are very methodical and thoughtful with our price escalation policy.  So I mean our sales reps don’t feel comfortable, but they have what they need to not just to compete, but to compete and win. \n",
      "Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein: All right. Thank you. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Steven. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Ajay Kejriwal with FBR Capital Markets. Your lien is open.  \n",
      "Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Thank you. Good morning. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Good morning. \n",
      "Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Naren, you talked about accelerating the pricing escalations in the quarter. So may be if you can talk a little bit about what was the driver, what’s the opportunity there and then also may be any color on the pricing versus attrition economics. How much could you push pricing without attrition kind of increasing to the level that kind of off set the economics there? \n",
      "Naren Gursahaney:   Sure. Well, as I mentioned in my comments, we are always trading off those five drivers of new accounts, subscriber acquisition cost, the revenue for user cost to service and attrition and working hard to optimize that.  During this quarter we made a decision to accelerate, it was about a little over 900,000 customers, so about 15% of our customer base. We generally see about 1% disconnect rate when we make those notifications or escalations. In this case we were very similar to that.  So again when you look at our price increase, it was in 4% to 5% range. So taking up that many customers at that kid of rate, even loosing that 1% which we don’t like to do, the economics were still overwhelming. That was the right thing to do for the overall return of the business. So we’ll continue to look at the all of those different trade-off and understand who we optimize.  I think we are competitive in the market palace from a pricing perspective, so I don’t think there are going to be big moves in the pricing necessarily, but we are going to continue to fine-tune that. We have never been the cheapest player out there, we’ve always been the premium player and we believe that our services and our infrastructure and support behind that justify that, as well as the innovation that we are bringing to make, so we’ll continue to look at that. \n",
      "Ed Breen: And back to the post comments Naren made, that’s really our favorite way to get increased pricing obviously. We are giving more to the customer or we get a higher price and we are all convinced its going to be a sticker account, which is one of Naren’s five levers, is to keep the account longer. So that’s our preferable and focused way to actually really get price moved up. \n",
      "Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Very helpful, thank you and then may be one question for George on the competitive dynamics. So one of your large competitors has publicly talked about execution issues and may be could be shedding assets in Europe. Could you may be talk about what this means in terms of opportunity for you, be it share gains or may be even as a potential buyer of those assets. \n",
      "George Oliver:   Well, as we’ve demonstrated we look at all opportunities, and we’ve been perusing a strategic, a pipeline of strategy bolt-on acquisitions that have added nice revenue and ability to be able to leverage that within our infrastructure and we will continue to do that going forward.  When you look at our performance, a lot of our permanence has been driven by the investments we’ve been making in products, so when you look at the continued investments or increase in those investments, its our ability with our regional footprint across the globe to be able to design and install systems and then even more importantly be able to service.  So I think it’s a combination of those, having a good position in all three segments. It really has provided us to be able to get though this cycle and now with the investments we are making be able to accelerate our growth going forward.  \n",
      "Ajay Kejriwal - FBR Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is open. \n",
      "Gautam Khanna - Cowen:   Yes, good morning guys. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Good morning Gautham.\n",
      "Gautam Khanna - Cowen: Just wanted to ask about the flow order pipeline, obviously its strong showing this quarter, water coming back. I mean is this the high water mark in terms of kind of year-over-year order growth or kind of what is the duration of the pipeline you have out there. How far can you see out? \n",
      "Patrick Decker:   Yes, this is Patrick. The way I would answer that would be, we expect to continue to see robust order growth in the valve control business, that’s really the one, one of the three businesses, but truly is a backlog business.  The other two businesses water and thermal are typically quick turn kind of businesses, expect when these bit major capital products kind of flow through. So I would expect over the back half of the year, valves and water orders will continue to be stronger. We do have the impact here for couple of quarters with the year-over-year compare with this big major capital project in thermal that we completed in this last quarter.  We are currently pursuing two other major capital projects that were close to us earning drills on its well. But those probably won’t hit the order book until either latter part of this fiscal year or even early 2013. \n",
      "Gautam Khanna - Cowen: Okay and then just to follow up on the prior question about the ADT attrition picking up, to the price increases, that typically happens immediately or is there kind of a multi quarter kind of fall out once you raise price.\n",
      "Patrick Decker: No, we generally get a pretty quick feedback, some activity in the call center. Some of those we are able to save and some of them we are not. Now again we do have some additional escalations that will happen in 3Q, not to the magnitude that we did in the second quarter, probably 60% to 70% of what we did during the second quarter. So again there could be may be a 10 basis point head wind as we looked at 3Q. \n",
      "Gautam Khanna - Cowen: Okay, thank you guys. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Thank you Gautham. \n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Hey, good morning. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Hey Steve. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Just on the quarterly, the next quarters guide, is there any specific reason why conversion at ADT Resi would be kind of weaker than it’s been on a sustainable basis. I mean you mentioned some marketing aspects this quarter, may be there’s something to do with the account change that makes the conversion a little bit weaker, because you had a good quarter, on the third quarter last year, I don’t know if that’s seasonally or not and then the flow revenue guidance of about 12% is good, but orders up 21%. Is there something kind of the tail of the backlog?  And then one last question just on corporate, for the last like several years you guys have guided corporate up, for the next quarter and you’ve beaten on corporate. I mean I don’t quite understand the strategy there, because your never really going to get credit for that, so using corporate is kind of like a hedge to our guidance. It doesn’t really seem to make sense. I mean what is going on there and it seems like it’s sustain ably lower over time, but you guys keep guiding it higher every quarter. So just a question on those three items. \n",
      "Ed Breen:   Steve, let me start with the question on the ADT margin rate I guess. You know a part of it really is the business model and I’ll try to do this at a very high level. When we sell a system through our direct channel, I assume that the cost, the net cost to us is about $1000. About $500 of that, all of our marketing spend and all of our fixed cost related to sales, we expense in the current period. So the only thing that would get differed in an ADT owned system is the sales commission, the equipment that goes in the home and the installation cost.  So while from a cash perspective the economics are very good, we do take a P&L hit and actually our margin rate on an incremental account, an ADT owned account is actually negative in the quarter that we had that account. So as we grow there will be that P&L pressure on there. However again, looking at it on a cash basis, the IRR, net present value of those accounts are very attractive and it is creating long-term value for us.  So its an initial hit up front and then as there is amortization and we pull that differed revenue off and we get the recurring revenue, those margins get significantly better over time. So clearly it’s just the account and your treatment of those accounts that we’ve got online. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, got you. \n",
      "Patrick Decker: This is Patrick. I’ll take the flow question regarding organic growth. So again to put it in perspective, for the full year we are expecting organic growth in the low teens compared to 1% in 2011. So we are beginning to see the turn there.  Just to look at the pieces here Steve and see how the mix works, we are expected continued low teen growth in valves and that really is just a matter of timing of backlog shipments. Again this backlog can turnover a six to nine month timeframe, so that will continue.  We are seeing the pickup in water and that will be a very stronger double-digit growth year-over-year as well, and again more of that will hit us in even Q4 into 2013, which is when we get the full-on impact of those water projects.  And then really what is moderating, some of that revenue growth versus what we would put it in order, I mean most of our thermal business is a quick turn shift within the quarter, but last year we had significantly growth in thermal during 2011 and through the first half of this year and that was really driven largely by the completion of a couple of major capital projects.  So again, you are going to get a tougher year-over-year compare in the second half of the year, so we will show a modest decline in reported revenue for thermal in the second half. But as I mentioned earlier, its not a sign of help in terms of an issue to major projects that we are closely signing that will then benefit their team. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, that makes sense, in the corporate. \n",
      "Frank Sklarsky : Steve on the corporate side, and this is Frank, two primary items there. When we look out to the third quarter, which is the quarter we normally do our actuarial liability evaluations, we really don’t know exactly what the number is going to be until we complete that analytical process. But we do have an estimate therefore with the trajectory and what we think that will be, that’s one time that impacts the sequential uplift.  The other item is really the timing of project expense, where we see some sequential basis and some additional spending on product related items in the third quarter versus Q2.  Now that said, with respect to the corporate hedge or whatever, that’s why we are saying this time around that before the year it will be $360 million versus the previous estimate we had our there at 390 so to your point, we are defiantly making progress on structural cost within the general and administrative category and the corporate category. So we are comfortable at this time taking that number down to the year in total. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay and the one last quick question, this is a backward looking question, about stuff that’s in your prior, your 10-K that was filed several months ago. With regards to all the NOLs that you guys have, first of all, where did most of those come from? I mean there has been a lot of deals in Tyco over time and looks like they kind of carry through, some of them carry through 2030 and I guess specifically the ones in the U.S., the $1.8 billion in the U.S., are those transferable easily and then is it pretty evenly spread out through the next 20 years?  If you could just maybe describe the genesis of those NOLs and then your ability to transfer them, and also if there is a chunk that’s expires near term, maybe just describe that a little bit more. And then that’s a question on your 10-K that was filed every three months ago, four months ago. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen : Steve we’ve never disclosed where the NOL have been generated and by what business in our filings. The only think I can say about that, I keep in mind our opening comments that we had and we are in the registration period and I know the production is more geared to where they are going.  The one thing that I will point you to is we have disclosed in the ADT From 10 what the expectations thereof are, NOLs that they have and what their future exception is of what they will get of their share of Tyco and we also some information about that disclosed in a slides that we posted in regards to the Form 10, but that’s about all we can say on the right now. \n",
      "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan: Okay, all right, it was worth a try. Thanks. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Thanks Steve. \n",
      "Operator: We have a question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Yes, thanks, good morning. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Hi there. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : So Naren, you talked about the metrics in the household in the U.S., relatively low compared to cable. I mean in terms of the market research you’ve done, where you think that tenders should make them go and what kind of strategies can you adopt to drive up penetration without using price as a method for doing that.\n",
      "Naren Gursahaney: Well, I think I would use value as the driver and we believe that over time and it could be a long time to get there, that its actually double to the 20% kind of penetration rate, which is still well below all of the – excuse me, it’s the 40% that would be still well below all the other services that we talked about. But it really comes down to, can we continue to strengthen the value proposition starting with the security piece, but all the other monitoring we do in the homes, fire, critical conditions, carbon monoxide, etcetera, and then bringing the home automation piece.  At this point in time, with pulse being out there for about 18 months we have anecdotal evidence that it is brining in people who would not have considered a security system in the past, but there is just not enough market data out there to show whether that’s truly moved the needed or not and we’ll continue to keep an eye on that. \n",
      "Ed Breen: I think a big driver Naren’s team has been looking at here is we haven’t been overly public about it yet is, can we really present to the consumer the savings you can get from using the automation in the system and we’ve mentioned this before, but the utility savings on the home used properly, along with you get a discount on your insurance anyway if you have a security system.  My gut is over time, those two combined is a pretty large number and it covers a lot of the recurring revenue that the consumer would pay us. So promoting that overtime and all those type of things I think does expand the pie. If you can cover a lot of the cost and get the full security system with automation, that’s a pretty attractive propositions. So I think you will be seeing more of that from us in the future. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay and then, I don’t know if I missed the data point, but can you just throw out there what your ARPU was in your gross adds in ADT this quarter.\n",
      "Antonella Franzen : The average ARPU was 37.98 and the gross ads were – the account-based ads were about 2%. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Net was 2%. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : 2%, but the ARPU on gross adds?\n",
      "Antonella Franzen : 3.5% and the average ARPU for the quarter was 37.98. \n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: Nigel, I’m sorry, were you asking what the ARPU was on the new accounts. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : The new accounts, yes. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen : 24.50. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay great. And then you are making some adjustments to the accounting in ADT but how does your accounting compare to some of your accounts. I mean there is not a lot of great public information out there, but some of the comps our there do have higher EBITDA margins and I’m wondering, is that a function of accounting or is there a significantly upside potentially to your EBITDA margins there and I’d love that comments.\n",
      "Ed Breen: Well, first just a clarification, we are not changing the accounting, we are changing the business model, its really in a mix of ADT owned versus customer owned. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : That’s clear, sure.\n",
      "Ed Breen: And from a comp perspective, I guess most of our peers within the security industry are not public companies. And many of them use a dealer model which would be similar I assume to the way we do handle that, where you create the intangible and you amortize it over the life of that customer relationship.\n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: Yes, this is one Nigel you might be talking about is a security comp that is almost, it is a 100% dealer. So they go to that model, but we have also our direct model, so that is one difference when you look at the accounting of it. \n",
      "Ed Breen: Going back to the question earlier, on the accounting for our dealer-acquired systems, those would actually be marginally accretive when we buy it. We amortize those over the life of the relationship, it is an accelerated amortization, but we do get the revenues. So it might be in the high 20s to low 30s gross margin, which is lower than our overall gross margins, but again accretive, modestly accretive to our operating margins. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then one final one for Pat. In the flow business, can you just give us a sense in terms of where the values, water and thermal business are compared to their prior peak levels? \n",
      "Patrick Decker:   Compared to what? \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Their prior peak levels.\n",
      "Patrick Decker: In terms of profitability. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : No, no, in terms of revenues. \n",
      "Patrick Decker: In terms of revenues, I can’t give you specific numbers on the three splits right now, but I would say just kind of anecdotally I would say valves is getting back closer to where we were pre-crisis levels, but there is still room to go there and I think that we are certainly see very buoyant activity in the market still in terms of project bidding, etcetera. So there is still a very, very nice runway there in front of them. What obviously is coming out of a trough and so well below what our peak levels were there going forward, and so we are expecting very good growth there. And I could say thermal is kind of flat lying right now, relative to this big project we had over the last year of so, but have some very, very nice projects in front of us that we think will then be a nice booster revenue in ‘13 and beyond. \n",
      "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley : Okay, that’s helpful, thanks. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen: Operator, we have time for one more quick question, if there is anyone else in the queue. \n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Deane Dray with Citi. Your line is open. \n",
      "Deane Dray - Citi : Thank you. Good morning. I don’t know if it’s a question for Patrick or Frank, could we get some color regarding that charge taken for the divested business. What triggered it and are there any other sort of contingent liabilities related to that divesture. \n",
      "Frank Sklarsky: I mean that’s one that we’ve had some modest charges in the past. I think as Patrick would agree, that project is nearing completion and will be cleared from anymore significant further liabilities done or there might be a some modest trailing items in the upcoming quarter, but this is one where the project is very much near completion. So we don’t see any more significant items in anything. We do see the modest nature we got a covered in the forecast that Patrick went through. \n",
      "Patrick Decker : And I would just add, it was a complex project that we inherited as part of a business that we divested and was just getting started at that time that the business was divested. Its proved challenging. We are very close nearing completion. It’s not a project within our suite spot, so we are wrapping it up now and hopefully putting it behind us. \n",
      "Deane Dray - Citi : Great, thank you and just then just last one from me would be for George. The word selective came up in describing the installation business and I know in the past year there was some initiatives to be more selective about the projects that you were going after. So if you could just give us an updated as to how has that initiative played out, what that means for the installed base and may be in terms of also the profitability of these installations.\n",
      "George Oliver:   I mean I would start by when you look at the installation market it has been down, it really tends to decline back in 2008 and is really still at the bottom and so in spite of that we have continued to maintain our market shares with what we’ve been doing in the installation space.  And so when we say selective, its making sure that from a resource standpoint we are applying our resources, where not only can we drive a profitable project installation, but also it drives recurring services down the road. And so its really around allocation of resources to ultimately drive improved returns over the lifecycle of the project. And so as you’ve seen from the results, we have been very successful in improving the margins not only on the installation side, but also continuing to be positioned to be able to get to recurring revenue just tied to those projects. \n",
      "Deane Dray - Citi : Great, thank you. \n",
      "George Oliver: Thanks. \n",
      "Antonella Franzen: Operator, that concludes our call. \n",
      "Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.\n"

      "Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Scientific Games First Quarter 2017 Investor Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Bill Pfund, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\n",
      "Bill Pfund: Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone. During today's call, we will discuss our 2017 first quarter results and operating performance, followed by a question and answer period. With me this afternoon are Kevin Sheehan, Chief Executive Officer; KJ Tjon, Chief Operating Officer and Mike Quartieri, Chief Financial Officer. Our call today will contain statements that include forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed during the call. For information regarding these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our earnings release issued today, the materials relating to this call posted on our website and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 3, 2017, as well as subsequent reports filed with the SEC. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures this afternoon. A description of each non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in our earnings press release, as well as on our website. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and a replay of this webcast and the accompanying materials will be archived in the Investors section at scientificgames.com. Now let me turn the call over to Kevin.\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Thanks, Bill. And good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. Our first quarter results mark the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases in both revenue and attributable EBITDA. Revenue grew 6% to $725 million. On a constantan currency basis revenue would have been up nearly 8%. Our attributable EBITDA increased 11% to $287 million, reflecting the higher revenue and 160 basis points improvement in our margin. Our margin benefited from the actions we took in the fourth quarter to streamline our organizational structure. This is a great start to the year, all three of our operating business segment contributed to the revenue and earnings growth. Our success is rooted in the efforts of entire team pulling together and I'd like to give my complements to all of our Scientific Game employees around the globe. I believe we are starting to see some real momentum across our businesses. In our gaming business, sales of gaming machines provided a strong boost to our results. Global unit shipments were up 24% over the prior year, table products also turned in an exceptional performance. Revenue was up 16%, reflecting both solid organic growth in lease revenue from our shufflers, proprietary table games and other table products coupled with the addition of the DEQ acquisition. DEQ's products are a smart complementary tuck-in to our existing table games business. The acquisition was completed on January 18th with cash from our operating cash flow and was quickly integrated. Our lottery business generated revenue and attributable EBITDA growth despite having a tough comparison with last year due to the incremental sales associated with the $1.6 billion Powerball Jackpot. Our instant games business experienced a revenue gain of nearly 5% in the first quarter, driven by our ongoing efforts to help lotteries grow their market and an increase in license game products. And finally but certainly not in the least, our interactive division continues to shine, its results were driven by strong growth in our social gaming B2C business, our strategy of leveraging our existing library of game content and intellectual property continues to deliver rapid top-line growth. Revenue growth exceeded the industry average on a year-over-year basis and reflects both share gains and market expansion in a healthy growing industry. Complementing the strong organic growth of the Social Casino business on April 7 we completed the acquisition of Spicerack Media, the [indiscernible] of Spicerack develop what has become the number four social bingo app the popular Bingo Showdown mobile game. The addition of a social bingo app is highly complementary to our existing game portfolio. Bingo games have an attractive player profile and financial characteristics and the acquisition will be immediately accretive to our earnings. Joining us today for her first call is KJ our Chief Operating Officer. KJ will you please review the performance of the gaming and lottery segments.\n",
      "Karin-Joyce Tjon: Thanks, Kevin, good afternoon, everyone. Our gaming business generated an $18 million increase in revenue over the prior year despite a $5 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment AEBITDA also increased by $18 million primarily due to the impact from higher revenue coupled with lower SG&A expense that resulted from the organizational streamlining in the fourth quarter. The A EBITDA margin of 47.7% was a 240 basis points improvement over the prior year. As Kevin mentioned, a key element of the revenue growth in gaming was a 24% increase in global unit shipments of gaming machines. During the first quarter, we shipped 8,359 new gaming machines globally compared with 6,748 units in the prior year. In the U.S. and Canada we shipped 5,862 units including 3,139 replacement units, 250 VLTs Oregon, 861 CGTs to Illinois and 1,862 units for new casino openings and expansions. The demand from new casino openings included shipments for the Ilani Tribo Casino in Washington where we received a 57% share of the shop floor including participation units. In addition, we shipped units to the New Kansas Crossing Casino and some other casino expansions. The higher shipments reflected strong sales of both the pro waves cabinet and the expanded TwinStar family of gaming machines. Reflecting a favorable mix our average sales price rose to $17,015 from $16,719 a year ago. In gaming operations, revenue was down 7% year-over-year and flat on a quarterly sequential basis. On a quarterly sequential basis, our footprint of WAP and premium units declined 322 units, but that impact was offset by a 3% increase in the average daily revenue of $1.73 per unit. The increase in the daily revenue was largely due to the continued installation of high performing Gamescape unit in our footprint coupled up with the seasonal improvement. The success of our Gamescape cabinet featuring the Willy Wonka, world of Wonka content continue to generate exceptional player engagement in its initial installation. We will follow the success of Willy Wonka with the highly anticipated launch of THE SIMPSONS game near the end of the second quarter. Additionally, the development of the new fully digitized game table remains on track and we expect to launch this innovative product in the second half of the year. The footprint of other participation and leased units was essentially flat on a quarterly sequential basis. An increase from the installation of VLTs in Greece was offset by the removal of some lower performing units in other markets. In Greece, based on the expected rollout plan communicated by OPAP we expect to have our full complement of 5,000 units installed by mid-year 2018, with a majority of the units installed by year end 2017. Gaming systems revenue of $62 million was up from $60 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting slightly higher hardware sales. We have begun to see increased traction on our new innovative iVIEW4 display, which provides a dramatic revolution in player engagement for our systems customers. As Kevin noted table products revenue rose 16% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in the leased revenue from shufflers, proprietary table games, and other table products. The total installed base of proprietary table games progresses and shufflers continue to expand year-over-year on a quarter sequential basis, reflecting both organic growth from the introduction of our new products such as the Shuffle Star continue shuffler along with the benefit of the DEQ acquisition. Turning to Lottery. Our revenue increased $1 million inclusive of an unfavorable $2 million foreign currency translation. First quarter lottery results had a tough comparison to the prior year, where in the first quarter of 2016 it included about $5 million of incremental benefit from the $1.6 billion Powerball jackpot. Lottery segment AEBITDA increased $4 million or 5% compared to the prior year quarter, largely due to the impact of the higher revenue, lower SG&A expense, resulting from lower payroll and associated cost and a slight increase in EBITDA from our joint ventures. Looking a bit closer to revenue. Instant games revenue increased $6 million or nearly 5% over the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in revenue from sales of license games along with the higher revenue from price per unit contracts, reflecting the timing of new game launches. Year-over-year services revenue decreased primarily reflecting the tough comparison with last year's first quarter results, which had benefited from the large Powerball jackpot. The addition of the Arizona Systems contract essentially offset the impact from the expiration of the Indiana Terminal Services Transition Agreement. Now let me turn the call over to Mike.\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: Thanks, KJ. Good afternoon, everyone. Continuing on from gaming and lottery, our interactive segment had another great quarter, revenue was up 33% year-over-year to $96 million and our growth once again exceeded the industry norm on a year-over-year basis. As a result of the strong revenue growth operating income increased $6 million and AEBITDA rose nearly $8 million or 49% compared to the prior year period. The AEBITDA margin increased to 23.9%. While the margin improved it's important to recognize that our interactive business is at an early stage of development and growth. Our original social casino apps, Jackpot Party and Gold Fish continue to provide double-digit growth and we have expanded our offering with the addition of new casino apps. Leveraging our extensive library of gaming IP and game content, each of these new apps provides differentiation and therefore creates the opportunity to appeal to a broader market and grow our paying customer base. The marketing support to create awareness, the player acquisition cost to build the player base and the prelaunched development investment are the primary drivers behind the increase in SG&A expense in the period. Our interactive B2B business, which includes our game content for real money gaming and our SG Universe social solutions also increased in the quarter. Revenue grew 30% over the prior year period despite the unfavorable impact of about $1 million of foreign currency exchange. At the corporate level, operating expense increased as the benefit from lower payroll cost was offset by higher legal costs. Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased $10 million to $111 million, which included $13 million of cash payments related to the business improvement initiatives we implemented in the fourth quarter. Changes in working capital contributed $7 million to cash flow compared to $19 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow was essentially flat year-over-year as the $10 million increase in operating cash flow was largely offset by $10 million in capital expenditures. Midway through the first quarter, we completed a very successful refinancing. Since we've previously discussed this, I won't rehash it in detail. In summary, as a result of the refinancing transactions, we lowered our cash interest, reduced our exposure to variable interest rates, extended our maturities and paid off the $45 million outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. Given the refinancing occurred midway through the quarter, our interest expense for the period reflected about half of the benefit. We recorded a $29.7 million charge for the extinguishment and modification of debt related to the refinancing transactions. During the quarter, we also completed the $21.5 million acquisition of DEQ, which was funded from operating cash flow. And we incurred about $3 million of acquisition related expense included in restructuring and other which was an add back to AEBITDA. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $17 million during the first quarter. In early April we used available cash on hand to fund the acquisition of Spicerack Media into our interactive business, which is immediately accretive to our earnings and operating cash flow. Going forward, our primary goal remains to create operating improvements and opportunities that will enable us to further reduce leverage. And now I'd like to open up the call for questions, operator?\n",
      "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen at this time we'll open the floor to questions. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Barry Jonas from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Barry Jonas: Hi guys, just a couple from me. Kevin, is there still room to cut cost out of the business or is your focus not really more on driving the top-line?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: I think we have to be measured, but there is still a solid opportunity as we get through quarter-by-quarter. This is something that I think is going to be not big amounts in any particular point in time, but just operational excellence and scale benefits as we get moving. So it should be accretive benefits every quarter.\n",
      "Barry Jonas: Great. And then you guys have been exploring ways to monetize your interactive business since I think September. Just wondering where you are in that process, and maybe some general thoughts about the double down sale?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yes I'm not sure we're actually -- we're not looking to do anything aggressively at all. We have a great business that's growing phenomenally well. We've got the best in class management team, we've got very creative development people in that business. And we see a long runway of growth. However, just when you talk about the double down and another great competitor. And when you look at the multiple that that business was able to achieve. And you look at the trajectory of what we are accomplishing I think that bodes well for us and I'll leave it at that.\n",
      "Barry Jonas: Great, and if I could just ask one last one. I think game apps was maybe one part of the report where we saw a little bit of contraction. Just curious where we are in the cycle there and if you think stabilization is near?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yes, I think I am little disappoint to be honest with the performance in the first quarter and we have in our hands kind of approach on that right now. And we believe that the Gamescape success and making sure of our sales team understands the power of what it's been accomplishing, where it's been launched. Is a great story to tell to everyone that hasn't brought the games yet and we feel that we have got an improving trend as we go through the remaining quarters of the year.\n",
      "Barry Jonas: Great, thanks so much.\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: You welcome.\n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Wieczynski from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Steven Wieczynski: Hey, good afternoon guys. So I guess first on the slot side of things. Obviously you had a really strong quarter for the for sale products and you obviously benefited from some new properties, but as we look at the replacement, the replacements were essentially they are up slightly just pretty much flattish. And I guess the question is, what are you hearing from your customers in terms of replacement spending as given how we are seeing some upticks here in some of these regional markets. Are any of your customers are thinking about getting a little bit more aggressive on the replacement side of things?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: I think it's a little early to say that we are seeing that, but just start to sense a feeling that with the seizure situation starting to move into the past and the reinvestment cycle starting to be more obvious and the economic situation starting to modestly improve that we're cautiously optimistic that things will be a little bit better than the neutral that you are referring to, but let's wait and see.\n",
      "Steven Wieczynski: Okay, got you. And then going to the interactive side of things, I know a couple of your competitors out there said acquisition cost have started to pick up a little bit in a space. Is that something that you guys are seeing are you being pretty rationale in terms of what you willing to spend?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: I think if you look at the results, it speaks for itself and I would say that this is the thing why I said we have a management team that I believe is really, really top notch and we are paying for leads that are -- that have a return on them. So I think our guys are very disciplined. So I don't see any change in that trend.\n",
      "Steven Wieczynski: Okay, got you. And the one quick question, not sure if you will answer this or not. But obviously your stock is in a very positive more here in the last six months or so and I guess with your leverage still being pretty high at this point. Is there any thought in terms of potentially using equity to drive down leverage at some point?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: No I think we feel very confident, our management team here feel some power to drive the business forward and have no interest in doing that at this point. Not to say that things don't change but right now we feel very confident with our position and where we are going. And would rather see us ourselves delever, the old fashion way.\n",
      "Steven Wieczynski: Okay, great. Thanks Kevin, appreciate it.\n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from David Katz from Telsey Advisor Group. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "David Katz: Hi, afternoon. And I wanted to follow-up on the social rather interactive aspect of the business. Can you talk a little bit clearly you have a long runway within I believe is what your comment was. Can you talk about the dual aspects of that on the one side being a B2B and the other being B2C and how you see those evolving when you indicate you had a long runway for them?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yeah I think each one is -- you're exactly right it's a little bit of a different story. On the B2C we have got -- one of the things when I came in was we don't know where we are going with the business let's always be thoughtful about the alternatives whether somebody comes along and wants to offer some fortune which we are not interested in right now or we go and say, hey, you got the track for the future for an IPO. So we always want to be looking at that growth rate and the way we see the business today we have a phenomenal opportunities going forward and at these outsized growth rates we want to keep running as fast as we can on that business. And on the B2B you saw the growth there as well and I think we have a compelling preposition and as the operators continue to watch what we are able to accomplish I think that growth continues as well.\n",
      "David Katz: Are there any sort of data points or anecdotal support from customers on that B2B side in terms of what they are looking for or what they aspire too that you as the sort of leader on the enterprise system side can engage with? If you could pull a little more meat on that skeleton?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yes, I think it's the fact that the Scientific Games and our powerful brands have very strong content and making sure we're thoughtful to provide a solution to our customers to enhance their repertoire for their customers is very important to us as well. So I think we're just going to continue to do what we've been doing without getting into the recipe.\n",
      "David Katz: Very good. And if I can just ask one more detail, is there any sort of update on your CapEx expectations for this year and any qualitative thoughts you can give me around '18 would be helpful as well? And that's it from me.\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: Sure, it's Mike Quartieri. No, in the press release we reaffirmed our original guidance between $280 million to $310 million. And I think that would a consistent expectation. I think every year going out unless there is a major system project on the lottery side that we would need to fund.\n",
      "David Katz: Got it, thank you very much.\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: You're welcome.\n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Malouf from Craig-Hallum Capital. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Mike Malouf: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Hate to keep harping on interactive, but when you take a look at the EBITDA multiples I mean the EBITDA percentage that you have this quarter obviously up from last year. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense of since in this growth phase currently, what is the potential for EBITDA margins in interactive, is it as profitable as the other parts of the business?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: I think we have -- we can't talk about forward-looking stuff, but I would say that Mike's commentary earlier on is really if you think about it as we become bigger and we have more games launched, the marketing associated with the new games becomes a lesser factor as you think about it in '18 and '19 et cetera. So, with that I think we are all confident that the margins will continue to grow. If we were to stop investing in the future, we have much higher margins, but that would be with the secret formula we have right now that wouldn't make any sense. So we're going to build that business very carefully and grow the margins, but also be thoughtful about making sure we've got the next big thing coming down the path.\n",
      "Mike Malouf: Okay, great. And any plans in the near future or even perhaps in the next 12 months for further refinances with regards to the debt?\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: No, I think we're just going to continue to watch the markets and take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves.\n",
      "Mike Malouf: Okay, great. Thanks.\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Of course we will. We're going to be smart about it of course.\n",
      "Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Staph [ph] from Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can I guess expand your thoughts as you think about machine sales segment you had an extra ordinary growth in first quarter I know a lot of that kind of extra ordinary growth was from the Ilani. And I guess how do you think about this business going forward? And your story obviously has a number of moving pieces. So I wanted to see if you're comfortable to the extent you can help us bracket ship share I guess if you look at your stock and you look at your operational turnaround past year or so, you have been able to stabilized that declining ship share and I guess as of the end of the year it was kind of maybe 27%, 28%. The first quarter I guess in theory would go up given the outstanding performance and I was wondering where you think you can take that again just trying to think about the pathway and what you could actually do with the gaming unit segment?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yes, I think at the end of the day the market share gain is got to be very capital, because that's usually not a winning proposition. The success of this brand and the other brands we compete with very good companies is the success of the games that you produce and we've got a lot of effort as you guys know in R&D to make sure we're thoughtful about the games that are coming out so that we continue to attract the attention of all the casino operators because if you have a successful platform you're going to sell the product, and that's critically important to us. So that coupled with the signing of just as an example, I believe we have this unprecedented opportunity with the signing of James Bond and having the right stall of the movies and all the Bond characters and all the Bond ladies and all the characteristics and you think about Bond and what that has done for the gaming industry, there is always a couple of scenes there. So it's incumbent on us as an organization to make sure that we are being very thoughtful about this as we look to the next generation of gaming and trying to be on that cutting edge to say, hey, here is some new thoughts and new thinking. And I think we've got a lot of effort right now going on into making sure we're being thoughtful about that and creative to ensure that we're taking full advantage of that signing as an example.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: And I guess can you talk about maybe the Ilani as a case study about, what were some of the things that contributed obviously you're getting such a high share and whether or not you can replicate that elsewhere?\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Yes I mean I think it gets back to content. And I think we have a great reputation in that market and the success. So beyond that I don't think we want to get into.\n",
      "Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.\n",
      "Operator: And ladies and gentlemen our final question for the day comes from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Chad Beynon: Great, thanks for taking my question. Mike you finished your response for the CapEx with unless there is another lottery big CapEx. And I wanted to kind of poker that for a second, we've read that in Italy there could be discussion of pulling forward the instant ticket contract which is a very profitable you had a very expensive one. Could you just help us think about I guess what's out there in the press anything legislatively and then more importantly, if this is pulled forward how you would value that versus some of your other opportunities? Thanks.\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: Obviously Italy is a key market for us from an instant product side. So we're going to do whatever we need to do to make that we maintain that position and maintain that revenue and EBITDA growth for our company. In regards to really other CapEx items, I think the next line of contracts that are really coming up we've already talked about the Maryland System contract moving forward at this point. There is legislative meetings taking place in May which we're hope that the contract gets signed at that point. Pennsylvania is out for until the end of '18. Italy will be out till 2019, so at this point those are the three main contracts that we have we would be looking for to make that type of large scale investment in.\n",
      "Chad Beynon: Okay. And you haven't heard anything from legislatively from the Italian representatives or your contacts there that this could potentially be pulled forward I guess that was the first part of my question on that.\n",
      "Mike Quartieri: No, not at this point.\n",
      "Chad Beynon: Okay thanks. And then just switching gears to the Spicerack acquisition, this complements a lot of your home grown games. Are there any other segments with also kind of within social gambling where you think you could add on to kind of bulk up your overall offerings to customers? And that's it from me.\n",
      "Kevin Sheehan: Sure and obviously we're not going to get specific on that. But I would tell you that we have our eyes out to make sure that we'd be thoughtful when something like that comes along. This acquisition I believe is going to turn out to be a fantastic one for us. And if you look at the business model of the number one and the number two player in that space, you'll see what they did once they expanded the reach of the Bingo with the introduction of some gaming within in that proposition. So those are the kinds of the things thinking out of the box to kind a create the incremental value is what would get us interested.\n",

      "Kevin Sheehan: Okay\n",
      "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen at this time, now we will conclude our question-and-answer session.\n",
