       "  \"Operator: Good morning, and welcome to today's ConAgra Foods First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This program is being recorded. My name is Jessica Morgan, and I'll be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host from ConAgra Foods for today's program; Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer; and Johan Nystedt, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Nystedt.\\nJohan Nystedt: Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. And while we are making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which include cautionary language. Also we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found either in the earnings press release, Q&A or on our website at investor.conagrafoods.com, click Financial Reports & Filings, then Non-GAAP Reconciliations. Now I'll turn it over to Sean.\\nSean Connolly: Thanks, Johan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter conference call. This will be our last earnings call as ConAgra Foods as we anticipate completing the Lamb Weston spin-off this fall prior to the holidays. As you've probably seen by now, we announced the timing of dedicated Investor Days for each business. Lamb Weston's will be held in New York City on October 13, and ConAgra Brands will be held on October 18 here in Chicago. Our teams are hard at work preparing for these meetings, and we are excited about the opportunity to take you through a deeper dive on these businesses and why we believe they will create significant value for investors as separate pure-play public companies. Each company will share more details, including financial outlooks and capital allocation priorities at these events. We are confident you will see the unique opportunities available to both companies and why each is well positioned to seize them. Now on to the state of the business and our first quarter results. Once again, it was a very busy quarter at ConAgra as we continue our disciplined and methodical approach to enhancing focus, expanding margins, improving efficiency, energizing our culture and ultimately, creating value for our shareholders. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with the progress that we have made to date. At a high level, we saw strong results from both Lamb Weston and our branded consumer businesses. On Lamb, we once again saw what a terrific business this is. Sales were up, margins were up and profit was up. The team is looking forward to sharing much more about this jewel of a business on October 13. On our branded consumer businesses, we also made terrific progress. Here, we are seeing clear evidence that our strategy to upgrade our revenue base and expand margins is working. As we have discussed previously, we are intensely focused on positioning our U.S. branded portfolio for long-term success and that starts with building a higher-quality revenue base. As we will discuss in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we compete in good categories with many well-known brands that are Number 1 or Number 2 in their categories. However, ConAgra historically prioritized volume over value and accordingly, we've been overly reliant on deep discounting as our chief demand driver, leading us to under-invest and under-deliver on brand building and innovation. In short, we underleveraged some of our greatest assets. The result of this behavior is a revenue base that is overdeveloped in terms of the presence of low-loyalty, price-focused consumers. The problem with catering to these consumers is that, (a) it caused us to neglect the needs of the vast majority of our consumer base, people who are hungry for innovation and premiumization and, (b) it fundamentally limited our ability to drive higher margins. We are changing that. Specifically, to ensure we leverage our brand strength and unlock our margin potential, we have been methodically infusing focus and discipline around pricing and trade promotion while investing in brand building and innovation. Said differently, we are focusing our efforts on practices that support value over volume and walking away from our previous practices that concentrated on volume over value. It is important to understand that while our efforts to improve brand building and innovation are broad-based, the volume declines we're experiencing are largely concentrated within brands that historically targeted the price-focused consumer and heavily relied on deep discounts and promotion to drive volume. In fact, if you dig into the scanner data, you will see that more than 80% of our Q1 volume declines can be attributed to just six brands that have historically been underpriced and over-promoted. We are confident that our actions represent the right way to maximize the value of our branded portfolio over time. As a supporting data point, gross margins on our U.S. retail brands are up about 700 basis points since Q1 two years ago. As we continue to execute this strategy, we believe our revenue base will be better positioned to deliver stronger, more consistent performance over the long term. We have framed our efforts here around five portfolio management principles, or PMPs as we call them, which guide how we intend to manage our branded portfolio going forward. At our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we will go deep on each of these, but I want to give you a sense of our approach. PMP number 1 is upgrading the revenue base. The second PMP is refreshing the core. PMP number 3 is assigning clear portfolio roles. The fourth PMP is ramping up innovation and M&A. And the fifth PMP is effectively backing the winners. These principles represent a tried-and-true approach and in a few weeks we will discuss the progress we're making on each and how they will help build a more focused, higher-margin and higher-performing branded food company over time. One note on PMP number 4, ramping up innovation and M&A. I'm sure you've all seen the news from earlier this week about our acquisition of the Frontera, Red Fork and Salpica brands. These businesses make authentic gourmet Mexican food and contemporary American cooking sauces. We believe this gives us another great platform to provide consumers with unique, high-quality food products. And as an extra enticement to attend our Investor Day on October 18, I promise you will have a chance to sample these tremendous brands. While we have a lot more work to do, I want to acknowledge our sales force for doing an excellent job working with our retailers to explain how our change in strategy benefits them as well as ConAgra. Similarly, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team for anticipating these volume changes and proactively offsetting any loss absorption benefits. With that context in mind, let's turn to our Q1 results. Q1 net sales declined 5% and the impact of divestitures and FX represented about 2 percentage points of the decline. As I mentioned at the outset, Lamb Weston delivered another strong top line this quarter, offset by sales results in our domestic consumer business. In the U.S. consumer market, which, as you know, is challenged across our competitive set, we saw declines due to the actions I just outlined related to upgrading our revenue base. This, along with the impact of FX, more than offset an increase in price and mix. Overall profitability was driven by growth and margin expansion in Lamb Weston as well as continued strong gross margin expansion in our domestic consumer businesses. As a result, total segment adjusted operating profit was up 23%. Additionally, our supply chain team continues to excel at finding more efficient ways to manufacture our products and reduce costs. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.61 for the quarter, representing 49% growth from the prior year, significantly in excess of our mid to high teens growth estimate. As Dave will point out, some of this is timing related. Now turning to segment performance. As you saw in this morning's release, we are now reporting results in five reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, the Refrigerated & Frozen, the International and the Foodservice segments represent the businesses that will remain with ConAgra Brands and will become the primary four reporting segments of the independent company postspin. The Commercial segment consists primarily of the Lamb Weston business.  Starting with the Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales decreased 5% based on the actions I just discussed. These efforts, coupled with increased pricing and trade productivity, savings and supply chain and continued SG&A discipline, helped drive growth of 31% in adjusted segment operating income, which translated to a 680 basis points expansion in adjusted segment operating margin. The volume declines in this segment were largely concentrated on a few brands where we are reversing our historical practice of promoting below the $1 price point. Chef Boyardee, and Snack Pack are good examples. Importantly, we saw the margin and profit expansion that we were counting on. Equally important, key sales fundamentals like distribution remained on plan reflecting customer support for our strategy shift towards stronger brands and innovation. Keep in mind, the plan does include some important SKU rationalization. So when you see TPDs pull back in the near term, recognize that is part of a disciplined program to reduce non-value-added complexity while increasing facings and velocity on priority SKUs. You'll hear more about this at our ConAgra Brands Investor Day in Dave Biegger's supply chain presentation.  Last point I'll make in this segment is that we continue to benefit from disciplined investment behind A&P-ready brands, such as Slim Jim and PAM among others. Now turning to the Refrigerated & Frozen segment. Net sales decreased 8% while adjusted operating profit increased by 310 basis points to 16% of net sales. The volume decline in this segment was heavily focused on Banquet, an important brand, as you know, is going through a significant makeover. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work to restage our Banquet brand resulting in increased pricing associated with long-overdue product and packaging upgrades. Accordingly, this was the primary driver of the volume and sales decline in the segment for the quarter. Banquet is now benefiting from much stronger margins, and our consumer data is also showing an improving buying rate from our most loyal consumers and key customers. As we move through the next calendar year and begin to wrap these actions, you will see top line sales declines moderate. From there, we will also fold in new product improvements and innovation. Regarding segment profitability here in Q1, our disciplined pricing actions and supply chain productivity more than offset the Banquet impact and the costs related to a product recall. One other planned action in Q1 is worth noting in Frozen. While Marie Callender's is not one of our historically over-promoted brands, it was over-promoted in the year-ago period. And that was not a good business decision, so we did not repeat it in Q1 this year. These two contributed to our volume decline, but, again, we saw the margin gains we were counting on. Elsewhere in the segment, we saw solid top line performance, namely in Reddi-wip, which continues to be a strong performer for us. The International segment, net sales decreased 6% due to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the effects of currency, segment net sales would have been approximately equal to the prior year's comparable quarter. Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 1%, and adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $24 million. This segment was negatively affected by normalization of egg prices after last year's avian influenza outbreak. Overall, the four segments that will primarily comprise ConAgra Brands' ongoing operation postspin have made good progress, demonstrating the strength of our plan and the opportunity that lies ahead. Much of our team have completed their first full quarter in our new headquarters in Chicago, at the Merchandise Mart, and there is tremendous energy and excitement to build upon our momentum as a pure-play branded company. Now turning to Commercial foods. As I said at the outset of my remarks, Lamb Weston delivered another great quarter, generating approximately 4% net sales growth. In our reported results, the strength of Lamb Weston's performance is masked by the fact that we include the impact of the divestures of Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank, which were completed at the end of July. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 33% in the quarter behind Lamb Weston's continued growth and favorable input costs. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, leveraging its strong brand to capture emerging markets and international growth. Tom and the Lamb team look forward to sharing much more during their Investor Day on October 13 in New York. Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our talented employees. Amidst significant change, including a successful move to our new headquarters, our team remained focused on delivering our goals and serving our customers. In addition to driving strong performance, our team is also dedicated to being a good corporate citizen, and we were honored to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the sixth consecutive year, demonstrating recognition of our commitment to environmental and social goals in addition to economic objectives. Now turning to one of our newest team members, I would like to welcome our new CFO, Dave Marberger, who joins us from Prestige Brands. Dave brings more than 30 years of finance and leadership experience to ConAgra Foods, including ten years as the CFO at Godiva Chocolatier and Tasty Baking Company. I first got to know Dave during his time with the Campbell Soup Company, and Dave is a proven and accomplished finance executive, and I am confident he will be a tremendous asset going forward. We are extremely happy to welcome him to the team. With that, Dave, over to you.\\nDave Marberger: Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my comments, I would like to say how energized I am to be part of this organization and leadership team. I look forward to getting to know many of you and the investor community in the weeks and months ahead. I will address several topics in my comments, including our new reporting segments; a recap of our 2017 fiscal first quarter performance; a summary of items impacting comparability, including some brief comments on goodwill impairment, cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet; and some brief comments on our upcoming Investor Day. As we outlined in the release, we now report our business results in five segments. They are Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments were previously included in our Consumer Foods segment and Foodservice was previously included in our Commercial Foods segment. Upon the completion of the Lamb Weston spin, the commercial segment will include only the historical results of JM Swank and Spicetec through the divestiture date, and the Lamb Weston results will be reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. Now I will provide some comments on our performance for our fiscal 2017 first quarter. Please note that references to adjusted earnings or operating profit referred to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Overall, net sales for the fiscal first quarter approximated $2.7 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter. The divestiture of JM Swank and Spicetec and the negative impact of foreign exchange accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the net sales decline versus the year-ago quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fiscal first quarter of $0.42 compared with $0.38 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.61, 49% above the $0.41 delivered in the year-ago quarter and better than we planned. The strong first quarter EPS performance primarily reflects the benefits from continued gross margin expansion, lower SG&A expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume, lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture and some costs related to a product recall. As I will discuss later, the first quarter overdelivery versus our plan was driven, in part, by timing items for both SG&A and A&P expense. In our Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $757 million for the quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 6% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $185 million in the first quarter versus $142 million in the year-ago quarter. The strong increase in adjusted profit reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts, driven by pricing discipline and favorable product cost and productivity; reduced SG&A costs; and lower A&P spending due to timing, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume. In our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, net sales were $605 million for the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago period, reflecting an 11% decline in volume and a 3% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $97 million in the first quarter versus $85 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in adjusted profit reflects the same continued progress on margin expansion efforts as outlined for the Grocery & Snacks segment, offset by approximately $9 million of costs related to a product recall. In our International segment, net sales were $195 million for the quarter, down 6% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 2% decline in volume, a 1.5% improvement in price mix and a negative 5% impact from foreign exchange. We reported a segment operating loss of $149 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by a pretax impairment charge of $164 million related to our Canadian business. I'll say more about this shortly. Adjusted segment operating profit was $15 million in the first quarter versus $17 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in adjusted profit reflects lower sales in gross margins and a negative impact from FX, partially offset by modestly lower A&P and SG&A expenses. In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $268 million for the quarter, down 1% from the year-ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $24 million in the first quarter versus $26 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower sales in gross margins, partially offset by lower A&P and SG&A expenses. In the Commercial segment, net sales were $843 million or 2% below the prior year quarter, driven by the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures. Lamb Weston had a very solid quarter as net sales increased 4% versus the prior year quarter. The commercial segment's adjusted operating profit was $148 million versus $112 million in the year-ago quarter. This strong increase was driven primarily by the net sales growth and margin expansion in our Lamb Weston business, partially offset by the profit decline resulting from the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures during the quarter. We realized proceeds of $486 million from these divestitures and recognized an aggregate book gain of approximately $198 million. We expect to utilize the capital loss tax asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to these divestitures. In addition to the segment information, I will also note the following matters related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $24 million for the current quarter and $37 million in the year-ago period. The decline principally reflects lower profits from our Ardent Mills joint venture. Adjusted corporate expenses were $38 million in the fiscal quarter versus $66 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts, along with lower costs related to the timing of certain expenses that will come later in the fiscal year. Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $69 million, down 18% from the prior year quarter. Most of this decline was due to the timing of expense that will be incurred later in the fiscal year. Despite this lower spend, total gross rating points for our A&P investments were up 7% for the first quarter versus a year ago, reflecting improved efficiency. For the first quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $11 million and operating profit by $4 million versus the year-ago quarter. Moving on to our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making very good progress and expect to realize the remainder of our $200 million of SG&A savings over the next two years as planned. While we saw significant benefits from SG&A savings in the first quarter, I would point out that some of this benefit was due to the timing of certain expenses moving to later in the fiscal year. We estimate that the benefit from timing for SG&A was $25 million to $30 million in the first quarter. I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter. We had $0.34 per diluted share of net expense related to impairment charges. Approximately $140 million pretax relates to impairment of goodwill and approximately $24 million pretax relates to impairment of intangible brand assets, both related to our Canadian business. The charges are principally the result of several factors. First, the change in our reporting segments now requires us to evaluate goodwill at a lower level. In the past, under the previous reporting segments, we were only required to evaluate goodwill at the total International business level. We are now required to evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit within the International segment. Second, while the performance of our International business has been steady over the last several years on a constant currency basis, the significant weakening of the Canadian dollar has negatively impacted the value of the Canadian business on a U.S. dollar basis, which is used for the goodwill analysis. Finally, the brand impairment reflects both the unfavorable foreign exchange movements as well as some weaker top line trends in this portion of the business. In addition to the impairment charges, we recognized $0.17 per diluted share of net gain from the sale of the JM Swank and Spicetec businesses. We also recognized $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. And finally, we recognized approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net benefit from favorable adjustments to state tax assets. Moving on to cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $795 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the first quarter were $337 million versus $64 million in the year-ago quarter. This significant increase is due to the improved operating earnings in the current quarter and higher-than-normal income tax payments in the year-ago quarter. For the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $117 million versus $102 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter due to the paydown of debt during the past 12 months. For the quarter, we paid down approximately $554 million of long-term debt, and dividends for this fiscal quarter were $110 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $86 million, and we had approximately $46 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter. We continue to remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments. Lastly, our estimated effective tax rate for income from operations remains at 33.5% for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. The first quarter reported tax rate was higher primarily from the tax impacts of the noncash impairment charge and the gain on the sale of JM Swank and Spicetec. As we have noted in the release, we are not providing any comments on our outlook today. Instead, we will provide more information on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and the long-term algorithm for both ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston at our upcoming Investor Days. We are excited about the opportunities to create value for both of these companies. This concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I, along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session.\\nAndrew Lazar: Just two questions on gross margin, if I could. In the quarter, gross margins expanded about 200 basis points and recognizing pricing and trade spend discipline and some input costs favorability were some key drivers, I guess, was any of this due to maybe some supply chain initiatives that may have been taken but not maybe yet talked too publicly? Or is more of that on-the-come, so to speak? And I then I've just got a follow-up.\\nSean Connolly: Well, we'll talk quite extensively, Andrew, about our plans with supply chain when we get to Investor Day. But on gross margin, obviously, there are a number of different things that are contributing to the gains we are seeing and the gain -- the size of the gains do vary quarter-to-quarter. But the important fact is that, over the past two years, we've made tremendous progress at gross margin and operating margin, and you saw that again this quarter. Quarter-to-quarter, the progress may vary due to a number of factors, but what I'm focused on is that we continue to move the centerline of our profitability north over time, while reducing the standard deviation around that centerline. On supply chain, look, first of all, clearly, the overall goal of our collective efforts is value and margin maximization. And supply chain productivity programs have always been, and will continue to be, an important component of that. And as Dave Biegger will share at our upcoming ConAgra Brands Investor Day, strong productivity has been a legacy strength at ConAgra, and you saw some of that also this quarter. We do have a strong track record of continuous improvement in terms of network optimization, procurement, T&W, et cetera, and now that we're upgrading our volume base and reducing low-margin business, we are providing a better foundation to build off of, as we plan for future margin accretive innovation. And Dave has obviously brought a fresh perspective around how to sustain that strong historic supply chain performance and build on it even further, and he'll share those views in a few weeks.\\nAndrew Lazar: Got it. And that leads into my next one, which is based on some of the filings of Form 10s and such, it shows that ConAgra Brands will have a or does have a gross margin that is certainly substantially -- despite the progress, right, substantially lower than the large cap peer group. And I guess, I'm just curious, and I know you'll talk more about this in couple weeks, but is there any, I guess -- or how much of that gap, let's say, with the group do you see as maybe structural? Or any reason that this gap, I guess, can't be significantly narrowed over time? And is it something we'll hear more about perhaps at the Investor Day?\\nSean Connolly: Yes, it certainly will be, and if you picked up on one of the comments I made, Andrew, in my prepared remarks, if you look at our branded businesses in the U.S. as an example, you've seen margin improvement of about 700 basis points versus the same quarter two years ago. So clearly, we believe and we demonstrated that we can do the things necessary to expand those margins and by no means do we think our work is done. We will continue to chip away at that, and we'll do it using a number of different factors. And we talked about those factors but, hopefully, investors are getting a sense of how relentless we are in terms of pursuing margin expansion.\\nOperator: And we'll take a question now from David Driscoll with Citigroup.\\nDavid Driscoll: I wanted to ask just a little reconciliation on the quarter itself. So the timing issue was, I think, you said $30 million, so that's something like $0.05, and then the lower tax rate was maybe worth another $0.04. So is it correct that maybe if you think about this quarter, let's say, a $0.54, it's still a very solid beat over your original guidance, but those two other effects are notable. Is that -- do I have those correct?\\nDave Marberger: Yes. That's correct on the $30 million, David, with the SG&A and the tax rate is actually higher because of the impacts of the sale and the impairment.\\nDavid Driscoll: Sorry, versus the estimates that were going into the quarter is what I'm getting at for how we were modeling this. But okay, fine. And then as you look forward here, the -- is there any comments that you can give us on dyssynergies? Really, Sean, your comments are so very positive, but I always wonder if when breaking these things up, isn't there just fundamentally a dyssynergy number that's got to be overcome? And would just appreciate, I know this is maybe in advance of the big Analyst Day, but is there anything you can do to help us because we've got to put numbers out today for the forward forecast and would appreciate any comments on the dyssynergy computations.\\nSean Connolly: David, the strategy that we've been undertaking to transform this portfolio, we've been at it now for a while, and we have anticipated that you will have some things that flow back against you. It's one of the reasons why we moved so aggressively on the $300 million efficiency program right out of the gate is because we wanted to stay out ahead of this stuff. Similarly, it's the same reason our supply chain team is aggressively trying to get out ahead of any absorption benefits that we might lose when we pull back on volume. So we try to look around corners. We try to anticipate it and then we try to stay ahead of it. So with respect to ConAgra Brands, sure, there will be some modest stranded as we go ahead and step through these things, but that's part of the reason why you see us getting so aggressive on costs. Lamb is a standalone company, and you'll see the details on that in the Form-10. And obviously when you set up a standalone company, you're going to incur some unique costs for doing that but obviously, we strongly believe the benefit of having Lamb as an independent pure-play company with its great performance and growth prospects is really the story there. That's a terrific equity, and we can't wait to tell investors about the story in a few weeks.\\nOperator: We'll take a question now from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.\\nRob Moskow: Sean, I was -- in your prepared remarks, you said a lot about trying to get away from the highly priced sensitive consumer by walking away from a lot of these promotional programs, and I think that makes a lot of sense. I think one of the challenges you might have at the Analyst Day is, the perception of the portfolio of ConAgra is that a lot of the brands are targeted towards price-sensitive consumers that they are value brands. In your work on those brands, have you found kind of like a segmentation within those consumers that X percent are really price-sensitive for Chef, for example, but Y percent are very loyal. And do you have any insight for us on that that could help us?\\nSean Connolly: Yes, I'll make a brief comment, Rob, and then I'll turn it over to Tom McGough to add some color. But when we're talking about these incredibly, what I'll call, price-obsessed consumers who really only buy on prices, it's not a large percentage of the user base. I mean, there is plenty -- way more brand loyal users in the user base in brands like Banquet. The issue is catering to that small group that is super price-sensitive has an unwanted effect on the balance of the business. So we've got terrific brands. And keep in mind, you've got millions and millions and millions of households out there that make $50,000 a year that need good value and -- but they are incredibly brand loyal households as well. Tom, you want to add anything to that?\\nTom McGough: Sure. What I'd add is, we will provide data that splits our volume base across loyals and switchers, and the vast majority of our consumer base are those consumers that are loyal that buy their purchases based on the strength, the benefit, the features of our products. I think what Sean highlighted is that, by focusing on incremental volume to trade promotion, we're subsidizing the purchases of those people that would normally buy us at full retail price. And our focus on trade is trying to improve the ROI on those merchandising events. So at the end of the day, we will have a stronger consumer base with a higher percentage of loyal consumers, and we will drive margin improvement through the trade productivity that we will invest in those attributes that those consumers are looking for over time.\\nOperator: Ken Goldman with JPMorgan has our next question.\\nKen Goldman: In looking at the SG&A reduction, I know you talked about how some of it was temporary. I'm trying to get a sense though of how much of the remainder of that, right, is still the majority of that reduction that's not being deferred to later in the year, we can think of as maybe permanent. So maybe could you help us break out some of the drivers of that reduction, may be roughly bucket headcount reductions versus A&P savings, things like that? And I guess, as a carload to that, in terms of the amount that was pushed out of 1Q, I think you said $25 million to $30 million, could we model all of that being in 2Q? Or should we spread that throughout the year, as we look ahead?\\nSean Connolly: First of all, Ken, I'll start, and Dave, if you want to add any color, go right ahead. The SG&A program that we've been focused on is a $200 million program, that is not an A&P program. That is a structural SG&A program. And we are, obviously, making great progress against our $200 million goal. Yes, we are tracking a bit of schedule but also some of what you are seeing, as Dave mentioned, is timing. And we're going to get into our outlook in terms of how it will flow going forward in a few weeks when we get to our Investor Day for ConAgra Brands. But the way I'd think about SG&A or for that matter, any inefficiency opportunities, we got our targets, we're making good progress on our targets, and we'll always continue to look for more pockets of inefficiency because it just gives us more fuel for growth.\\nDave Marberger: And Ken, let me call on that.\\nKen Goldman: Okay.\\nDave Marberger: Just so if you look at SG&A and you have to work through all the adjusted items, right, so if you look at the total SG&A, if you look year-on-year, we're down about $75 million for the quarter. And as I said in my remarks, about $30 million of that is really a timing that will come in, in later quarter. So that's where -- $40 million to $45 million is really the incremental kind of run rate, if you will, for the quarter for that. As you know, we started the savings in fiscal '16 really in the Q3 and 4, so Q2 will be another big incremental quarter, and then it'll start to wrap in the second half of this year where the increases will be less. But by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be 85% to 90% complete in terms of the total $200 million reduction plan.\\nKen Goldman: Okay, that's helpful, Dave. Quick follow-up, if I can. On Lamb Weston, you decided to load it up with a decent amount of leverage. Is that the natural result of wanting ConAgra Brands to have a squeaky clean balance sheet, maybe for M&A? And I'm a little confused about the decision to spin it off without a permanent CFO in place, it's a little unusual. That's not about anyone in particular, I like John, I'm just not sure how much confidence investors are going to have in whatever path is, I guess, outlined at the Analyst Day given that there is a new CFO coming in a few months later. So maybe you could help us understand the decision-making there?\\nSean Connolly: Yes. Let me try to be helpful there, Ken. With respect, first of all, to the Lamb leverage, the ConAgra Board has been squarely focused on how to maximize total value, and this is top of mind when thinking about decisions like leverage. And as you'll see at Lamb's Investor Day in a couple of weeks, it is an extremely strong business with excellent cash flows, and we are quite confident that it will continue to thrive. Beyond that, we're going to hold off until the Investor Day to get into details on things like capital priorities. With respect to the Lamb CFO, I think the big picture here that I don't want investors to lose is, we are making excellent progress rounding out the Lamb management team. You're going to learn more about these folks here in short order as well as populating the Board with seasoned veterans that are really going to help this company get off, I believe, to a flying start. We are very far along in terms of the CFO search process. I don't want to get into the details of that process or our motives publicly for obvious reasons, but with the Investor Day just a couple of weeks away, we are very fortunate to have John Gehring help us get things launched. And for those of you who weren't tracking with Ken's comments, you might have missed the -- in this morning's announcement that John will be the Interim CFO here over the course of the next couple of months, as we stand Lamb up. But again, we'll have more to talk about on our permanent CFO in the not-so-distant future.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bank of America's Bryan Spillane.\\nBryan Spillane: Just two quick ones for me. First, and I might have missed this, but the effective tax rate in the quarter once you've excluded all of the one-time items, just -- what's the clean sort of effective tax rate?\\nDave Marberger: The clean effective tax rate, 33.5%.\\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then the second one for you, Sean, is just -- as you're going through this process of reducing the -- your promotional activity and taking that the volume hit that comes with that, velocity starts to slow. And sometimes when velocity slows, it starts to compound on itself. So can you talk a little bit about just what you are doing? What the circuit breakers are just to make sure you don't get yourself into a situation where you've got the sort of the volume base right but it's hard to restart some velocity because of where the momentum is? And I guess, related to that, just could you confirm, it sounds like with advertising and marketing may be down in the quarter, you're still going through this process of resetting volume at a time where there's going to -- you're not really maybe necessarily fully supporting the brands with the advertising you tend to?\\nSean Connolly: All right. There's a lot there. Let me try to hit the key points there. First of all, what we're doing it's a bit like if any of you have ever remodeled a house, it's a bit like that. The process is a bit messy, but if you want to get to the desired outcome, you got to go through the process. And this is a transformation that we're undertaking here, and our approach is to value profitable growth, not any growth but we do keep a close eye on markers to make sure that the business is in control and doing what we plan. So as an example, if you get into the scanner data and you peel it back, you'll see obvious things that you should expect such as baseline trends being significantly different from promoted trends. And then furthermore, if you get into baseline velocities, you will see that our baseline velocities are, in fact, quite stable. You will see TPDs going back, but you'll see TPDs going back because we, along with being very focused on price, have infused into the marketplace over a number of years a long tail of low-margin, nonproductive SKUs of multiple sizes that we are -- frankly, they had no value, so we've to get them out. Our customers appreciate that. It's part of being good category managers. And then the key is to continue to support the items that are moving at strong velocities, contemporizing them, refreshing them and then adding to them with new innovation and then ultimately proper marketing support. Now with respect to your question of marketing support in the quarter, yes, A&P was down. Some of that is timing because we do want to align our A&P spend with planned in-market actions like innovation launches and key promotions, things like that. So some of its timing, but some of it is just good discipline and getting rid of nonworking or attempted working marketing that just, frankly, wasn't. And that is you see -- and also buying better. Your GRPs were up 7% in the quarter on a fewer dollars, so the impact was reasonably respectable. And I think it's important that we keep that kind of support out there while we're taking some of these promotion items, so we can really evolve the conversation with our consumer to be about something other than price and that's we're doing. We'll talk about this quite extensively along with things like portfolio segmentation strategy in a few weeks at our Investor Day.\\nOperator: We'll move now to Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\\nAlexia Howard: Two questions. Firstly, on the volume declines. You talked a lot about how a lot of that's deliberate given the actions that you're taken to improve the quality of revenues. Are you able to tell us if you haven't taken those actions, what the underlying volume decline would have been? And further, are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of overall volumes are associated with these consumer segments that you're really not that interested in? So volume is the first one. The second question is we're hearing from a number of places that retailers, particularly large retailers, are beginning to demand more reinvestment in price and promotional activity, which seems to be the opposite direction from where you're going. How do think that's going to play out in 2017? And are you confident that you can sort of hold your ground without losing distribution?\\nSean Connolly: Sure. Alexia, I'll take the second one first. On the notion that some retailers may be asking for more promotion, quite frankly, that tends to vary fairly meaningfully by category depending upon what a retailer's objectives are with particular categories. In general, our customers are asking us for growth and innovation. They want to see us evolve our brand so that we're not competing on price, so that we're competing on quality measures. You see customers giving more and more real state to these challenger brands that have modern food attributes like natural, organic, premium. These are the things that consumers are demanding, and this is what many of our retailers in our categories are prioritizing. And it's precisely why we're evolving the businesses that we own as well as adding new businesses that are complementarity like Frontera, Blake's and others like that. With respect to our volume piece, let's go back to the point in my prepared remarks, I think, that really describes it best. This is a -- our actions are broad-based but the volume decline, when you add it up, is incredibly concentrated. And in our case, it was in our six brands, each of which has its own story as to what we're doing and why we're doing it. But if you use Banquet as an example because that's the biggie, here's how to think about Banquet. The bottom line is locking a brand into a $1 price point for decade. It's just not a good business decision because it puts relentless pressure on margins and in turn, food quality. And at the same time, it retrains our Banquet loyalists to buy on deal. So the change was long overdue. And while the topline optics can be ugly until you wrap a year later, it's up over 300 basis points, the business and grows margin, which is excellent news. Now we've got to continue to support the business with levers other than price. And that's what we're going to do, and that's what our customers are counting on us to do.\\nOperator: We'll take a question now from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.\\nLubi Kutua: This is Lubi filling in for Akshay. First question is just on the consumer brands businesses. If you can comment on advertising expense this quarter, just trying to understand the different pieces of the -- setting the profit outperformance this quarter. So how much was -- advertising expenses were down during the quarter? And how should we think about that going forward?\\nSean Connolly: A&P was down in the quarter, as we talked. GRPs were up so impact was up, but we spent less money. We will move -- some of those dollars are moved into the remaining quarters for the balance of the year, as we talked. But it'll -- a piece of it was timing and a piece of it was just improved efficiency.\\nOperator: We'll move now to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank.\\nMario Contreras: Sean, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some good outperformance from the supply chain team in offsetting some of the over head absorption from the volume declines. Can you talk a little bit more specifically about how they're able to go about achieving that? And then related to that, how were the volume declines tracking versus your expectations going into the quarter?\\nSean Connolly: Yes. The supply chain team at ConAgra has been doing a great job for a long time. I don't know how much we've talked about the capabilities that we've had with investors, but we intend to do that in a few weeks. And we've had very strong gross productivity performance historically, and we're continuing to work to not only sustain that but to find new ways to build upon that, and we'll outline that here coming up in a few weeks for you. With respect to the volume overall, it's pretty consistent with what we expect. And if you just go back to our last couple of quarters, I've tried to be very transparent around not only our strategy, but the implications of our strategy and the notion that it's not always pretty to look at but it's important that we go through this if we're going to get to a different place. And -- but we feel like we're squarely on track.\\nOperator: We'll take a question now from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.\\nJonathan Feeney: Sean, a lot of what you've done had obviously made tremendous improvements to the value proposition. And I'm wondering, how much of -- you talked about these, your price seeking, your value only consumers, how much of this is a change in the consumers, say, over the past three or four years where maybe the strategies that were good four years ago are less relevant today? And how much of this is just you bringing a fresh set of eyes and a new methodology to the business? And I asked because maybe that -- those trends continue and it's actually maybe it's a little bit of -- it's a great time for -- I shouldn't say it's a great time, it's a much improved time for lower and middle income consumers right now with falling gas prices and wage gains. And I wonder if maybe just that improvement is helping you realize this pricing and maybe better-than-expected results?\\nSean Connolly: The way I'd think about it, John, is when the consumer looks at a brand, the brand is going to communicate something to them. For a long time, our brands communicated deal. We are a deal brand and interestingly, even low income consumers are very interested in a brand communicating with them on other means. For example, there were -- there was a period of time in our past where our PAM business was heavily promoted and the only trick in the book that we turned to was dealing. But if you look at consumer trends in oil over the last few years, you see that the oils have changed, it's moved to things like olive oil, things like coconut oil. So instead of competing on PAM on price attributes, we've evolved the PAM business, and we've got olive oil PAM. We've got coconut oil PAM. These are relevant modern-day attributes that changed the discussion with the consumer to be about something that they value and they will pay more for and not about deep discounting. That's just one example. We'll talk about more examples at our Investor Day, but that's exactly what we need to do to get really the loyalty up on our business, get our prices up and build our overall brand strength to make it as modern as it can be.\\nOperator: Our final question today will come from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.\\nMichael Walsh: It's actually Michael Walsh filling in for Todd. Sean and Dave, you've been consistent in publicly stating your desire to retain an investment grade credit rating. And earlier, you mentioned that as well. You also mentioned debt reduction, and I know ConAgra Brands will get a $675 million payment from Lamb Weston with the spin. You're going to lose a chunk of EBITDA. Can you just talk about how much debt reduction you expect going forward? And do you have any type of leverage target that you would manage your balance sheet to?\\nSean Connolly: Yes, thanks for the question. With respect to balance sheet questions, we're going to get into that in earnest in a few weeks at Investor Day. But with respect to ConAgra Brands, big picture as we've said and as you pointed out, as we intend to continue our commitment to being rated investment grade, we'll continue to a balanced capital allocation philosophy with strong dividend and a willingness to buy back shares and an appreciation for smart, value creating M&A. All of those things are fair game, which is not a departure from where we've been but rather very consistent. But we'll get into more details here on that in a few weeks.\\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Nystedt, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.\\nJohan Nystedt: Thank you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release. As always, we're available for discussions. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra.\\nOperator: This concludes today's ConAgra Foods First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.\",\n",

    "Greetings, and welcome to the TDS and U.S. Cellular First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jane McCahon, Senior Vice President, Corporate Relations at TDS. Thank you, Ms. McCahon, please begin.\n",

    "Jane McCahon\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, Melissa [ph] and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want to make you all aware of the presentation we prepared to accompany our comments this morning, which you'll find on the Investor Relations sections of the TDS and U.S. Cellular websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "With me today and offering prepared comments are from U.S. Cellular, Ken Meyers, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Gockley, Vice President, Legal and Regulatory Affairs; from TDS Telecom, Vicki Villacrez, Vice President Finance and CFO.\n",
    "\n",
    "This call is being simultaneously webcast on the TDS and U.S. Cellular Investor Relations websites. Please see the websites for slides referred to on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. As a reminder, we provide guidance for both operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. For TDS Telecom, these are basically the same number. For U.S. Cellular, however, the adjusted EBITDA measure includes imputed interest income from EIP and significant contributions from our partnership, which we want to continue to highlight for investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information set forth in the presentation and discussed during this call contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Please review the Safe Harbor paragraph in our press releases and the extended version in our SEC filings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To update you on capital allocation in the quarter, TDS paid $60 million in dividend and repurchased $2.5 million of its shares, a modest number, although we did not acquire any cable assets in the quarter. As mentioned on the year-end call, U.S. Cellular filed a short form application for the upcoming auction for 600 megahertz spectrum known as Auction 1000. As the anti-collusion rules are now in effect, we are prohibited from speaking about it further, so we will not be entertaining any of the questions related to spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after we released our earnings and before the call, TDS and U.S. Cellular filed their SEC forms 8-K, including today's press releases and their Form 10-Qs. Later this month and prior to our annual meetings, we plan to be on the road in New York and Boston. Our annual meetings are in those week of May 23rd and we will be webcasting those for your convenience.\n",

    "Now, I'll turn the call over to Ken Meyers.\n",

    "Good morning. Turning to Slide 4, I'm pleased with our start for the year. Subscriber growth on data centric devices showed a nice pickup. Churn remained low, actually improved, and expense control remained tight. Cash flow was down slightly, as anticipated in our original guidance, showing the impact of the pickup in growth year-over-year as well as industry-wide pricing tension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by reviewing customer growth, our top priority. It was our objective to get the year off to a strong start, as those customers we had now contribute to a performance all year long and we saw some solid performance in the quarter. All handset gross adds were flat year-over-year, smartphone adds increased almost 4% and connected devices, primarily tablets, were up 21%. Sales of feature phones continued to decline. Smartphones represented 93% of all postpaid handset gross adds this quarter, up 400 basis points from a year ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the implications of the decline in switching activity across the industry, we are working to refine our value proposition and increase awareness of both our network quality, including our 4G coverage, and the availability of Apple and other iconic devices. It is still very encouraging that 21% of our gross adds are previous customers coming back to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last quarter I talked about a few initiatives we had underway to drive customer growth in 2016, let me expand a little on one in particular. We have intensified our focus on serving the small and medium sized business customers, including local and regional government entities. This is an underpenetrated market for us, and yet it is one perfect for us given our local positioning. In the first quarter, we saw gross adds from our S&D [ph] segment up 48%, albeit off a relatively small base but the point is we are definitely making progress in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I am particularly encouraged by our continuous improvement in churn and especially postpaid churn. Smartphone net adds were just over 20,000 in the quarter, compared to about 3,000 a year ago. About 25% of that increase is due to the pickup in gross adds I mentioned earlier, and the other three quarters of the pickup is due to improved churn. We all know churn is usually an outcome of something gone wrong. So we stay very close to our customers. We are constantly measuring customer engagement and adjusting our business practices and services to better meet their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our survey show this strategy is working as customer engagement is moving in the right direction, giving me reason for optimism about our ability to drive handset churn even lower in the future. To strengthen alignment around this customer-focused strategy, we’ve actually made customer engagement a company-wide measurement for success. So in sum, net postpaid customer additions totaled 45,000, up significantly over the 9,000 postpaid net adds generated last year, driven by smartphones and tablets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our customers overall satisfaction is largely influenced by our network strategy. Last year, we completed our deployment of 4G LTE. It now reaches 99% of all of our postpaid customers, providing an excellent network experience in our suburban and rural markets. Additionally, with multiple 4G roaming agreements now in place, our customers can receive better data experiences as they travel too. Finally, our network team is working toward our first commercial deployment of VoLTE, voice over LTE, early next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our device portfolio remains very competitive and we've seen some strong performance from the new Samsung Galaxy S7. Also, we've introduced expanded offerings on equipment installment plans which have been well received by our customers, as you can see with the take rate of 69% of postpaid sales to end users in the quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing our customer base is not enough, however, we must also capture additional revenue growth. The improvement in our smartphone portfolio and our expanded 4G network has steadily increased postpaid smartphone penetration which now stands at 75% of the postpaid handset base. Although notable progress has been made, we still have an opportunity to drive additional revenue by converting more of our feature phone users to smartphone users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our shared connect data plans allow us to capitalize on the increasing data consumption, so long as competitive pricing doesn't give away all of that future growth opportunity. Connected devices provide an opportunity to meet the expanding customer needs, while driving store traffic, increasing data usage and revenue per account. At the same time, the more we meet multiple customer needs, the more important our collective services become to our customers and the lower risk we face of customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I discussed in February, another strategic priority for 2016 is to reduce unit cost. As has been reported by others in the industry, we are seeing our customers holding on to their devices longer, which resulted in a 7.6% upgrade rate for the quarter. While this is low by historic standards, it is a slight increase from the most recent trend, impacted I believe by the successful launch of the Galaxy S7 to our customer base, which owned a good number of earlier Samsung models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved pricing on subsidized handset combined with the EIP higher take rate resulted in a 41% decline in loss on equipment per unit. Another example of our progress in this area would be 11% reduction in general and administrative expenses per average customer and a 7% reduction in systems operation expense per average customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we are off to a solid start, not a great start, not yet reaching aspirational levels but a solid start with improved customer results leading the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let me turn the phone call over to Steve Campbell. Steve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Steve Campbell\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a few additional comments on customer results which are shown on Slide 5 of the presentation. As Ken already mentioned, we grew our customer base during the first quarter with 45,000 postpaid net additions, a significant increase from 9,000 net additions a year ago. The growth was driven by positive results in both gross additions, which increased 8% year-over-year to 215,000 in postpaid churn which improved again this quarter to 1.28% compared to 1.48% a year ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the past few quarters, the growth in postpaid net additions was driven by data centric devices like smartphones and connected devices. Together, they accounted for 70,000 net additions. Net handset additions were negative 5000, a significant improvement from negative 31,000 in the prior year, driven by reduced churn. And although total handset net additions were negative 5,000, as Ken discussed earlier, smartphone net additions were positive 20,000, up from only 3,000 a year ago. On top of that, feature phone customers continued to upgrade to smartphones, with the result that total smartphone users increased by 63,000 during the quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the prepaid category, we had 12,000 net additions, the same level as a year ago. As shown on Slide 6, smartphones represented 92% of total handset sold this quarter, increasing smartphone penetration to 75% of our basic postpaid handset customers, up from 67% a year ago. Based on the levels of smartphone penetration achieved by other carriers, we believe that we still have opportunity to upgrade more of our remaining feature phone customers to smartphones and drive additional data usage revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "About 7.6% of our postpaid customers upgraded their devices this quarter, compared to 6.6% a year ago. This quarter's activity was influenced by the timing of new device launches. Compared to the fourth quarter, which is normally higher due to seasonal activity, this quarter's upgrade rate was down by about 90 basis points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next slide shows the longer-term trend in our postpaid churn rate, which is at a historically low level. Postpaid churn has steadily decreased from its peak of 2.29% in the first quarter 2014 to 1.28% for the first quarter of this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's talk about our financial results. Total operating revenues for the first quarter were $958 million, about the same as last year's $965 million. Service revenues were $760 million, down $68 million or 8% from last year, largely reflecting lower plan pricing due to industry competition and the continued migration to the unsubsidized pricing, meaning the planned discounts that accompany equipment installment plans sales and activations of customer owned equipment. The impact of lower plan pricing was partially offset by the growth in our customer base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equipment sales revenues grew 45% to $198 million, driven by higher equipment installment plans sales. The percentage of postpaid device sales on installment plans increased to 69% in the first quarter, compared to 53% in the fourth quarter and 41% a year ago. We expect the installment plan take rate to continue to increase over the remainder of this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Postpaid ARPU, shown on the next slide, was $48.13 for the first quarter, down 12% year-over-year due to price competition and continued migration to unsubsidized pricing. However, this metric excludes equipment installment plan billings to customers. The average billings per user, which includes those billings and provides a better representation of the total amount being collected from customers every month, shows a decrease of 4% year-over-year which is more indicative of the impacts of price competition and the growth in connected devices, which on a per device basis bring lower revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average revenue per account benefits from the increase in connections per account from 2.47 a year ago to 2.62. For the first quarter, it was $125.36, down 7% year-over-year. But when equipment installment plan billings are included, average billings per account actually increased by 1% year-over-year.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that there will be continuing downward pressure on service revenues as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized pricing, and our equipment sales revenues will continue to grow as the take rate for equipment installment plans increases. Another note is that as different equipment installment plan terms are offered under our accounting practices, the amount of revenue recognized in the period of sale could be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating cash flow for the quarter, shown next, was in line with our expectations. The success achieved in increasing the level of net additions impacted operating cash flow as expected, when we discussed our annual guidance with you on the year-end call. Therefore when looking at operating cash flow and the year-over-year comparison, remember that this year's number includes the cost of the incremental customer growth that we achieved. Retail gross additions increased by 6% and retail net additions increased from 21,000 to 57,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating cash flow for the quarter was $157 million compared to $167 million a year ago. The decrease was largely due to lower revenues as I discussed earlier. Total cash expenses were essentially flat year-over-year with an increase in the cost of equipment sold, offset by reductions in other categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted EBITDA shown next incorporates the earnings from our equity method partnerships along with the interest in dividend income, which consist mainly of imputed interest income from equipment installment plans. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $206 million compared to $209 million a year ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earnings from unconsolidated entities were $35 million. This included $19 million from the LA partnership, which was relatively flat year-over-year. As we expected, the LA partnership did not make cash distribution in the first quarter. At this time, the amount and timing of future cash distributions are uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I want to cover our guidance for 2016, which is shown on Slide 12 of the presentation. For comparison, we're showing our 2015 results, both as reported and excluding the impact of the termination of the rewards program. The current estimates are unchanged from those provided in February.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, for total operating revenues, we expect a range of approximately $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This reflects our expectation for modest customer growth, additional demand for data and a continued migration through equipment installment plans along with a very competitive pricing environment. For operating cash flow, we expect a range of $525 million to $650 million. The estimate for operating cash flow flows through to the estimated range for adjusted EBITDA which is $725 million to $850 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the extent that we achieve a lower level of customer growth than currently estimated, we would expect results to be in the upper portions of these ranges. On the other hand, to the extent that we are successful on attracting a higher level of customer growth than currently estimated or if the pricing environment worsens, we would expect results to be in the lower portions of the ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital expenditures are expected to be about $500 million. This lower level of spending compared to 2015 reflects the completion of our 4G LTE deployment. On the other hand, it includes spending to meet higher data demand and to prepare for the initial commercial launch of VoLTE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I want to make just a couple of comments about U.S. Cellular's cash flows and liquidity. Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter were $163 million, while cash flows used for investing and financing activities totaled $106 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and equivalents of $57 million. As of March 31st, cash and equivalents totaled $772 million. In addition to these existing balances, U.S. Cellular had $202 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that these resources are sufficient to meet our normal operating investment and other debt service requirements for the remainder of this year. However, these resources may not be adequate to fund all future expenditures that we could potentially elect to make, such as purchases of spectrum licenses in the FCC auctions or other acquisitions, and it may be necessary from time to time to increase the size of the existing revolving credit facility, to issue new debt or to obtain other forms of financing in order to fund those expenditures. In that event, accounts receivable under equipment installment plans represent a potential source of financing. At March 31st, the balance of those receivable was $391 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, John Gockley, the company's Vice President, Legal and Regulatory Affairs will provide a brief update on some of our activities in that arena. John?\n",
    "\n",
    "John Gockley\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, Steve and good morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning to Slide 13, this is proving to be a very active year on a regulatory front. Besides this being an election year, the Chairman of the FCC has made it known that he intends \"to run to the finish line\". There are a number of proceedings and issues currently in play which are of keen interest to us and which show signs of being resolved this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, just last week, the FCC announced at its open meeting, the issuance of a notice of proposed rule-making, proposing a novel approach to the long-standing issue of special access pricing in markets with limited competitive alternatives. The FCC is now proposing to look at the issue on a technologically neutral basis and to examine all providers of both traditional special access circuits and Ethernet facilities and not just incumbent telecos.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text of the NPRM was released jointly here this week and we are still in the process of reviewing it. We fully expect to be actively involved in those proceedings. The issue of special access pricing has been an open issue at the FCC for way too long, and we view the issuance of this NPRM as a positive development to resolving this issue once and for all. Ethernet backhaul still remains a substantial expense to us and will continue to remain so as consumers continue to consume more and more data services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FCC has also launched a proceeding to address the adoption of privacy rules for data services. This proceeding is a logical outgrowth of the decision to re-regulate broadband access as a tied on to common carrier service last year. This is a complicated proceeding with the notice of proposed rule-making keying up over 500 questions or comments. We've operated under the existing CPNI rules for many years now and we are fully committed to protecting the privacy of our customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ask only of this proceeding that the commission apply a balanced approach that protects customers without adopting onerous operational requirements, which are out of sync with the requirements imposed on other non-common carrier companies who have access in many cases to even more customer data than we do. Of course, we along with the rest of the industry are waiting with great interest to see what the DC Court of Appeals has to say about the FCC's open internal rules, which, depending on what the court does, may have a profound impact on this proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FCC recently released its Lifeline Reform Order which will transition the Lifeline program from supporting voice communications to supporting broadband access service over multiple years. Our Lifeline portfolio was a very small part of our business and other than some operational issues associated with the transition, we think that this conversion will have a very little impact on our business. We are currently exploring whether our Lifeline discount apply to data services as contemplated by this order will provide the company with a meaningful opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are, however, dubious whether the Lifeline discount of only $9.25 will have much effect on data service subscribership by low income Americans. We would have liked to have seen the FCC entertain a higher discount amount, given that the goal of the program is to drive broadband access subscribership by the most economically challenged Americans higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly is the issue of the future of the Universal Service high cost program, the wireless broadband deployment in rural, unserved and underserved areas of this country. This remains an important issue for the company and for our customers living in rural America. This past February, our Chairman Ted Carlson testified before the Senate Congress Committee about the continuing need for government support for wireless broadband deployment in rural regions and the need for better and more accurate data so that informed decisions could be made about where to deploy facilities and about how much support is necessary to bridge this digital divide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Chairman also made note of the profound effect that 5G networks are likely to have on broadband access, and he suggested that funding decisions concerning USF needed to take into account the cost and complexity of bringing 5G networks to rural America. We think his message was very well received.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, recently through the leadership of Senator Joe Manchin, the Senate Congress Committee approved an amendment to the FCC Reauthorization Bill, instructing the FCC to conduct a feasibility study into ways to gather better and more accurate data about the state of wireless broadband deployment in the rural America. We think this proposed law has merit and clearly signals the FCC a concern of reaching important USF decisions based on incomplete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We intend to continue to work with Congress and regulators in the design and implementation of a Universal Service Program that will meet our national goals to provide broadband access to rural and urban America alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. TDS Telecom's overall results for the first quarter were in line with our expectations. First Wireline revenues declined 2%, which was primarily due to the impacts of the divestitures we completed last year. Adjusting for these effects, Wireline revenues were nearly even with last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, Cable revenues grew at 3% rate, reflecting growth in both residential and commercial broadband revenues. And third, HMS revenues grew 5%, due primarily to increased equipment sales but also includes growth in reoccurring service revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cash expenses increased modestly across all three segments as we continue to position for growth. As a result, adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis declined 4% year-over-year to 76 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning with Wireline on Slide 16, our investments on our network in efforts to make higher speed options available to customers continue to drive growth in IPTV connections. We also continued to see increases in the take rate on 10 megabits and higher broadband products. In the first quarter, we rolled out one new IPTV market. We've now launched TDS TV in 28 markets and enabled 174,000 service addresses for IPTV service.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are completing our planned fiber build to reach approximately 21% of our ILEC service addresses. And when combined with copper service, our IPTV enabled markets cover approximately 25% of our service addresses. For the reminder of the year, we will focus on driving IPTV high-speed broadband bundle in these markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further strengthen our broadband offerings, we are deploying bonding technology to an additional one-third of our ILEC service addresses, to drive higher speeds in our middle tier ILEC copper markets. In our remaining markets, we are evaluating the FCC's modified universal service funding mechanism to support broadband build out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this modified USF mechanism announced in March 30th, the FCC is providing greater return carriers with two paths to receive funds. The first path includes a voluntary model-based approach, which we could elect on a state-by-state level and includes a fixed amount of support for a 10-year period in exchange for meeting defined build out obligations for broadband services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second path is based on existing rate of return mechanisms, from which we receive support today, but will carry substantial modifications going forward, including a reduction in the allowed rate of return, the elimination of support in competitive areas and defined build-out obligations. In general, we are pleased with many aspects of the order and are carefully evaluating our options under the two paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now looking at the metrics from the bottom of the slide, IPTV connections grew 50%, adding 12,800 subscribers compared to the prior year. And we added 2,800 broadband connections excluding divestitures. We are offering a variety of speeds up to 1 gigabits service in all IPTV markets. The uptick on IPTV has grown steadily and is now at an average penetration rate of 28%.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember 97% of our IPTV customers take all three services, which results in a low churn rate and drove an increase in average revenue per connection up to $43.28 in the quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflecting both our fiber and bonded cooper deployments, residential broadband customers are continuing to choose higher speeds in our ILEC market, with 49% choosing speed of 10 megabits or greater and 18% choosing speed of 25 megabits or greater which also contribute to the higher ARPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at Slide 17, Wireline results were mildly impacted by ILEC divestitures. While I'm going to give you the actual results as presented, on a same-store basis we were a bit stronger. Residential revenues increased 2% as growth in broadband and IPTV more than offset the decline in our legacy voice services. The year-over-year decrease in ILEC residential voice connections has held at about 3% over the past seven quarters excluding divestitures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial revenues decreased 4% and high margin wholesale revenues decreased 5% this quarter. On a combined basis, total Wireline revenues declined 2% to $173 million. Wireline cash expenses increased 2% as increases in employee related expenses and IPTV content cost outpaced the reduced cost of provisioning legacy services. As a result, Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased $5 million or 8%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 18, cable connections growth. Total cable connections grew 5% to 284,000. On the residential side connections increased, driven by 8% growth in broadband and a 23% growth in voice. This growth more than offset the continued declines in video connections. The residential broadband subscriber growth drove a 200 basis point increase in broadband penetration. While total commercial connections were flat, broadband connections grew 14%.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Slide 19, you can see total revenues increased for Cable 3% to $45 million, Residential revenues increased 1% as higher promotional offerings offset the connections growth. Commercial revenues increased 10%, primarily as a result of price increases through video. Cash expenses increased 6% as higher programming cost and property taxes were offset by cost synergies achieved from the acquisition synergies we are seeing. As a result Cable adjusted EBITDA remained relatively flat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning to the HMS segment and speaking from both Slides 20 and 21, the HMS business remained focused on growing reoccurring service revenues. Our hosting service revenues grew 2% for the quarter. Last year we invested in building data center space and we are focused on selling across our portfolio of services, which will utilize available data center capacity and increase revenues without requiring significant capital investment in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equipment sales improved $2 million due to the higher spending by existing customers. Cash expenses were up 2% compared to the same period in the prior year, which mainly reflects higher cost of itself to support equipment sales. Other operating expenses were down as reductions in employee expense has had a meaningful impact. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA increasing by $2 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provide our guidance for 2016 on Slide 22, which is unchanged from the guidance we shared in February. I will remind you that these numbers do not include considerations for the impact of FCC USF reform order. Overall, we are pleased with the results of the Telecom's first quarter and we'll continue to update you on a successful execution of our strategic priorities throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",

    "Thanks, Vicki. And operator, we're ready to take questions. I'll let folks know we have other people in the room, Kevin Hess, Telecom SVP responsible for Government and Regulatory Affairs; Doug Shuma, Corporate SVP of Finance and others are in the room with us. So, Melissa [ph], we'll take our first question.\n",

    "Question-and-Answer Session\n",
    "\n",

    "Ric Prentiss\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks, good morning.\n",

    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey, Ric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jane McCahon\n",
    "\n",
    "Morning, Ric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ric Prentiss\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey, let's start with U.S. Cellular, Ken, as we think about this quarter versus last year, last year the growth was not as significant, so on the short-term basis, EBITDA and operating cash flow did a little better. This quarter more investment for the long-term you're seeing the growth, so what I'd like to kind of get at with the question is as you think about the guidance, what level of gross adds should we be expecting for that to hit the high end or the low end? Because obviously you're seeing 15% growth -- or I'd say it was 8% growth in the gross adds on the quarter was significant compared to last year. I mean gross adds over the year were down 15% versus 14%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Ric, that thing is exactly the one that we grappled with as we established guidance for the year. From a strategic standpoint, I want -- it is necessary for us to continue to grow the customer base, that is both by some of the marketing programs like I talked about in the SMB area, it's about driving gross adds and it's also about driving down churn. Both of those on the one end have cost involved with them, and so when we put together our guidance there, we talked about how we were going to use promotional activity that if it was successful, would manifest itself in operating expenses and higher adds. But because it was promotional, it wasn't as successful. You'd have less expense, more cash flow but not the adds. The first quarter -- this is just what we wanted it to do. We got off to a nice fast start and our objective is to continue to build on that. Our objective is to continue to grow the base, which is why the cash flow guidance, as an example, is where we put it for the year. The most successful year will have us growing the base and continuing to invest cash flow and staying within the guide, which is why we reiterated it, and we're reiterating it today, we aren't changing it. So if the market turns soft, right, we will have less adds and we'll just see more cash flow coming to the bottom line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ric Prentiss\n",
    "\n",
    "Right. So should we expect gross adds kind of at a similar year-over-year level, as I'm thinking of that, if you're successful growing the business, it would be kind of similar to the first quarter in general?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ric Prentiss\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, also you mentioned optimistic handset churn to go even lower, one item spread recently when they reported did start breaking out handset churn from other churn, so hopefully you can kind of continue to give us maybe that extra data point on what handset churn is. I assume there's not much tablet churn in the current timeframe though?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Not much, but in fact our handset churn is lower or better than tablet churn, but both of them are important products and we continue to see very good customer retention across all of the supply line. In fact, the one we haven't talked about, prepaid actually showed some really nice improvement in churn year-over-year also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ric Prentiss\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. And then EIP if I understood Steve's comment right, you expect EIP to actually increase through the remainder of the year, what level of EIP do you think we could reach as we look at customers liking this type of plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we can look at what others have done and see rates meaningfully above where we're running, but understand our marketing strategy is not to drive EIP for EIP sake but rather to make sure that we've got the right products and services in the market for our customers and to make sure that either one of them, or all of them rather, are profitable for the business. So customers that want a subsidized model, we want to make sure that we've got an offering that works for them as well as an EIP offering that works for those that want that. So it's an outcome, it's not a target. So I don't sit there and say, gee, we want more or less of this. What we want is the right products in the marketplace for our customers. So could it go higher? It absolutely could. It did go up to 80%. We've seen that in other places, but that's not a target, it’s an outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ric Prentiss\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. And then finally, just one question, I swear, so the other piece of it clearly is upgrades, industry level upgrades where we're fairly light this quarter. You touched on the Samsung Galaxy S7 was a bigger exposure to you, but as we think about your guidance and comparing it to the rest of the industry, where are your thoughts as far as what upgrade levels would look like this year?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think about upgrade rates, and this quarter it's about 7, 7.6% and that's lower than the fourth quarter, lower than the third quarter, and it's lower than the second quarter of last year. It was above first quarter of last year. And when we look at it year-over-year one of the, I think, drivers to that was the success around the Galaxy 7. If you think about our customer base, we lost customers in the past because we didn't have an iPhone in the portfolio. And as a result, I think it's the distribution of our customers, we have a customer base that likes Android and is very, very happy with the Samsung devices. And given where we've had successful launches in the past, first quarter, the five two years ago, are at the end of their two-year contract, and now with EIP last year rolling out and is in the upgrade twelve months, we had a base that was waiting for this and we had a very successful [indiscernible]. We are targeting a lower upgrade rate, but again, it's about making sure the programs that we put in place work economically for us until we see -- we're seeing nothing to suggest we're going to be running higher all year, but it was successful first quarter with the Galaxy product.\n",

    "\n",
    "Great, thanks. I'll see you guys later next week.\n",

    "Okay. Thanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey, guys, thanks. I guess first on the Wireline side, can you talk about the HMS strategy. It seems like the growth isn't coming through the other way that we'd hope. How is that strategy coming together?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure. This is Vicki. As you think about HMS, HMS is really still a very important part of our growth strategy. And as you know, we've been very focused on integrating our five businesses that we acquired and going through and standardizing the processes and systems and trying to drive that reoccurring revenue growth. I think we continue to make progress, but we still have more work to do. And as we see clear progress, we'll begin to set more milestones on around that reoccurring revenue growth. We saw nice growth overall, 5%, but as you know we want that to be higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. And on the Cable side, sort of the same question, should we look for revenue to be growing here or is the offsetting of subscribers and ARPU sort of trailing off?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "You know, as we said in our guidance for 2016, we're really focused on looking for mid-single digit revenue growth. And in the first quarter, I reported 3%. If you adjust for an accounting adjustment, it was really running about 4%. We are running heavy promotions that are driving that really strong growth that you saw in broadband connections, and we'll continue to monitor that growth throughout the year. But yes, we’re looking for mid-single digit growth which is meeting our expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. One for Ken, I think a lot of people expect or sort of understand that revenue per user on the postpaid side will come down, but it was pretty violent this quarter, anything one-time in there that we should be thinking about?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "No, nothing is violent, I think, here for us. In terms of when we launched the EIP offering combined with the impact of tablets, when you think about your mix, you get a lot of noise in that. When we look at revenue per account continuing to grow, and we've low pricing stuff in the industry too, but it's really right in line where we're kind of expecting it right now, Phil. No one-timers in there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. So that 48 is the right level and probably down from there as we continue the mix?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that there is still, from a service revenue standpoint, the still risk is that EIP kind of take rate keeps bouncing around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it. And can you give us an update on your wireless roaming, both inbound and outbound?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, so we've got 4G agreements now in place with three out of the four larger entities. We've got it launched with one of them already and working with others. Roaming revenue itself is, I'd call it modest, with that moving around a lot down a little bit year-over-year because of the pricing agreement entered into last year but roaming cost actually down even more year-over-year. So still continuing to manage that business pretty effectively. And importantly, as I think about it, it's the roll out of voice over LTE that would start to turn on next year, that turns that into a growth opportunity, because suddenly we’ll be able to serve customers from every carrier versus just the CDMA based carriers that we serve today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",

    "Got it. Thanks guys.\n",

    "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon Flannery\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you very much. Looking at the ARPU on the postpaid side, obviously the EIP transition is impacting that, can you give us a sense of what the sort of average EIP customer is paying in terms of ARPU as we get a sense of how that transition is working? And then any updates on the M&A environment over on the TDS Telecom side? Thanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon, it's Ken. I don't have in front of me something that's look at average revenue just on EIP account, so we can follow up with you, but I don't have that in the room right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon Flannery\n",
    "\n",
    "I can look at it. Something Verizon sort of talked about was when they expect service revenue to decline or to just sort of moderate, is that something you see in the next few quarters here as you make up to 50% EIP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "I understand the math in that. I think you've got -- as I said, there's three component that are, as I think about, washing through average revenue per unit. One of those components is the EIP mix, one of them is the product mix, as between handsets and other connected devices. And then there is just the industry noise around pricing. Yes, as you stabilize the EIP mix, that piece of it will moderate, but you still have an ongoing mix within the industry as more connected devices get added in there or as customers continue to hold units longer and get -- bring in their own equipment and wind up with discount. So there is room around that one metric. But that metric again is an outcome and that's something that individually gets driven and rather helps understand what's going on within the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon Flannery\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "And from the M&A side, on the Telecom side of the house, we continue to evaluate potential cable acquisitions. We continue to stay focused on that. As you know, I can't comment on any specific transaction until a definitive agreement is in place, but we're looking at acquisitions that meet our criteria which again is around looking at our competitive and demographic criteria that we've shared before in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then again, from an HMS perspective, you know, we are making progress as I said in my earlier answer, and we have had a strong start to the year in terms of sales. And I really look for that to translate into higher revenue growth in the second half of the year. And as we continue to perform and meet our milestones, we may look at smaller acquisitions in addition to the generation of organic growth in that business. But that would a longer term initiative.\n",

    "That's helpful. Thank you.\n",

    "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sergey Dluzhevskiy with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sergey Dluzhevskiy\n",
    "\n",
    "Good morning guys. A couple of questions if I could. So, first question, kind of a big picture question for Ken and Doug, so U.S. Cellular obviously has been turning around subscriber growth or so over the few quarters, but arguably investors have remained unimpressed including this morning. So in your opinion, what are investors missing in the investment story for U.S. and GDS? And what are the main building blocks in your opinion maybe you could reiterate for enhancing shareholder value in the near term and also in the long term?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Sergey, it's Ken, let me just start with that. Up until few hours ago when the markets opened, I felt we were marching right down that path. I looked at what we produced for the quarter, what we produced relative to our guidance, what we produced relative to consensus and we're really happy with where we started. The fact that we've got some part of our base that's looking for something different, I can only deliver on what I've kind of set out as our strategy. And our strategy is to continue to improve our local market position, continue to strengthen the company, grow revenues and grow cash flows. And I don't see anything else on the short-term horizon that's going to either change our strategy or change our trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doug Shuma\n",
    "\n",
    "And, Sergey, I'll just reiterate what Ken said, we're pleased with the progress that U.S. Cellular has been making. It doesn't come overnight. We're committed to helping them be successful and at some point whether the shareholders recognize that or not, we think they will. We don't have any imminent transactions engineering type things that would drive any immediate shareholder excitement if you will but we're committed to U.S. Cellular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sergey Dluzhevskiy\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. And a question -- another question for Ken. This is kind of relates to financial engineering or just looking at the asset base that you guys have. So, obviously you have a logical tower portfolio and you have been very clear that you’re not interested in monetizing the value of this portfolio, it's core to your business. But could you share your thoughts as you look at your portfolio now and [indiscernible], what are your thoughts on making those as a value and contribution from this tower portfolio within the context of U.S. Cellular strategy so that it would be more adequately reflected in your share price?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Sergey, great question. As you so aptly put it, strategic asset. It's important to us. It is critical as we continue to evolve our network and it's critical especially given some of the -- I'll call it games some of the tower companies are starting to play in terms of trying to extract more value out of their assets from their perspective of being a landlord. And so having a large portion of our towers that we own, and not subject to those pressures is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we continue to lease out our asset. If I look at it kind of on a same-store basis or comparable basis, year-over-year basis, our tower rentals are up 10, about 11% year-over-year. And so we will continue to capture as much value as we can in the marketplace off of those assets, while retaining the strategic control we need so that we can continue to evolve our networks. And it's amazing how we're just finishing out 4G, we're about to embark on voice over LTE which will require more modifications and people are already testing 5G, right? Well, you know, that's going to put more strain on those very assets or increase their value even more in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sergey Dluzhevskiy\n",
    "\n",
    "Right. And last question for Doug, I mean given the relativity of the stock price and also kind of given your outlook maybe for the environment in cable space, how should we think about your appetite for buybacks this year and just in general?\n",
    "\n",
    "Doug Shuma\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Sergey, I'm going to stick to the old answer to that. We're committed to our investment strategy of, for every $3 we invest in the business, returning $1 to the shareholders over the long term and I think you'll see that play out this year as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sergey Dluzhevskiy\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jennifer Fritzsche\n",
    "\n",
    "Great. Thank you. Two if I may, I wanted to ask first on VoLTE, can you mention next year, it's my understanding that for the CDMA player, it's a harder path to VoLTE, which might explain why some of the GSM players are ahead of, like Verizon? And then wondering if you're finding that as well that, maybe more technical question. And then secondly if I could ask about the competitive environment. We are -- C&T Mobile laid up a lot of this A block spectrum and get into more secondary market. Are you seeing any impact directly from them? Or is that -- it's really not evidenced in the churn, but I wanted to ask the question, are you seeing still more either ET&T and Verizon as being the main competitors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Good morning, Jennifer. Thanks for the question. First of all, with respect to VoLTE, yes, there is a pretty well documented fact that the coverage on the voice side with CDMA is a wonderful, wonderful product. And when you've built your network with that product and you then try to overlay voice over LTE in the same cell site, there is an initiate coverage what I'd call gap almost. And it's something that we saw in the tests that we ran last year, and it's something that our deployment schedule has been built around in order to eliminate it. And there are various techniques our engineers are using such as moving equipment to the top of the towers which gets back to having control over those towers, so you can move your equipment when and where you need it. And they're using other engineering tools so that when we do turn on VoLTE, we are able to deliver our customers the same and better services that they're getting now. So that's why we haven't been rushing to it, wouldn't be very deliberate and proceed with caution, like we have in every other technology change in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around your A block question, our primary competitors in our market are Verizon and AT&T in that order, and it's based upon which of them has the original cellular license in that market, which allows us to have one of them and Verizon or AT&T and the other to really on an economical basis build out a very vibrant coverage area. That 700 have some of the very similar characteristics. And so we've heard about other carriers trying to build up their 700's and increase their kind of competitive footprint. But particular to the question you asked about T-Mobile, they’re building out to my understanding the 700 A block, and we've been successful in most of our markets acquiring that 700 A block. So if we own it, they don't own it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jennifer Fritzsche\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "And we're seeing them in a couple of markets but the most part they're building out in markets around us, near us, and as we get to us turning on VoLTE, looking forward to be able to serve their customers as they roam into our markets.\n",

    "Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Group. Please proceed with your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Michael Rollins\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. Just a couple if I could, you know the first is just going back to the topic of ARPU, can you specifically disclose the performance of phone ARPU in its totality? And maybe just help us a little bit more on the bridge of contributing factors to ARPU performance during the quarter. I know you've given us a lot of commentary on the call to think about. I was just wondering you could put some more numbers to that. And then, you know, secondly, over time I think the management team has talked about the importance of being able to grow the top-line. And is there a timeframe over which investor could keep in mind in terms of when you'll be able to answer that question as you get through the EIP migration and continue to contemplate the competitive landscape? Is that a 12-month observation period, 24-month observation period, any thoughts on that duration over which the answer should become more clear? Thanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey, Mike, that's a couple of things. So, one, as I'll look at -- I don't have the information as I am sitting and talking to you now the bridge is one of the other talks about one component of the -- our revenue or not, we'll look and see it, what might be in the corners of all of our other analysis. But I don't have any of those here right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the timeframe, there isn't a drop date. I think Doug talked about how we're committed to this business. We continue to grow the customer base which is the precursor to growing the revenue. We also talked the work we're doing around roaming. I've not talked about the work we're doing around advertising. There are many different specs and logs kind of on the fire, the thing that we’re all working to drive revenue which is the key metric in any long term sustainable business. But I don't have a drop dead date to give you.\n",

       " 'Operator\\nGreetings, and welcome to the TDS and U.S. Cellular First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jane McCahon, Senior Vice President, Corporate Relations at TDS. Thank you, Ms. McCahon, please begin.\\nJane McCahon\\nThank you, Melissa [ph] and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want to make you all aware of the presentation we prepared to accompany our comments this morning, which you\\'ll find on the Investor Relations sections of the TDS and U.S. Cellular websites.\\nWith me today and offering prepared comments are from U.S. Cellular, Ken Meyers, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Gockley, Vice President, Legal and Regulatory Affairs; from TDS Telecom, Vicki Villacrez, Vice President Finance and CFO.\\nThis call is being simultaneously webcast on the TDS and U.S. Cellular Investor Relations websites. Please see the websites for slides referred to on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. As a reminder, we provide guidance for both operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. For TDS Telecom, these are basically the same number. For U.S. Cellular, however, the adjusted EBITDA measure includes imputed interest income from EIP and significant contributions from our partnership, which we want to continue to highlight for investors.\\nThe information set forth in the presentation and discussed during this call contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Please review the Safe Harbor paragraph in our press releases and the extended version in our SEC filings.\\nTo update you on capital allocation in the quarter, TDS paid $60 million in dividend and repurchased $2.5 million of its shares, a modest number, although we did not acquire any cable assets in the quarter. As mentioned on the year-end call, U.S. Cellular filed a short form application for the upcoming auction for 600 megahertz spectrum known as Auction 1000. As the anti-collusion rules are now in effect, we are prohibited from speaking about it further, so we will not be entertaining any of the questions related to spectrum.\\nShortly after we released our earnings and before the call, TDS and U.S. Cellular filed their SEC forms 8-K, including today\\'s press releases and their Form 10-Qs. Later this month and prior to our annual meetings, we plan to be on the road in New York and Boston. Our annual meetings are in those week of May 23rd and we will be webcasting those for your convenience.\\nAlso keep in mind that TDS has an open door policy. So if you\\'re in the Chicago area and would like to meet with members of management, the IR team will try to accommodate you, calendar’s permitting.\\nNow, I\\'ll turn the call over to Ken Meyers.\\nKen Meyers\\nGood morning. Turning to Slide 4, I\\'m pleased with our start for the year. Subscriber growth on data centric devices showed a nice pickup. Churn remained low, actually improved, and expense control remained tight. Cash flow was down slightly, as anticipated in our original guidance, showing the impact of the pickup in growth year-over-year as well as industry-wide pricing tension.\\nLet\\'s start by reviewing customer growth, our top priority. It was our objective to get the year off to a strong start, as those customers we had now contribute to a performance all year long and we saw some solid performance in the quarter. All handset gross adds were flat year-over-year, smartphone adds increased almost 4% and connected devices, primarily tablets, were up 21%. Sales of feature phones continued to decline. Smartphones represented 93% of all postpaid handset gross adds this quarter, up 400 basis points from a year ago.\\nGiven the implications of the decline in switching activity across the industry, we are working to refine our value proposition and increase awareness of both our network quality, including our 4G coverage, and the availability of Apple and other iconic devices. It is still very encouraging that 21% of our gross adds are previous customers coming back to us.\\nLast quarter I talked about a few initiatives we had underway to drive customer growth in 2016, let me expand a little on one in particular. We have intensified our focus on serving the small and medium sized business customers, including local and regional government entities. This is an underpenetrated market for us, and yet it is one perfect for us given our local positioning. In the first quarter, we saw gross adds from our S&D [ph] segment up 48%, albeit off a relatively small base but the point is we are definitely making progress in this area.\\nAlso, I am particularly encouraged by our continuous improvement in churn and especially postpaid churn. Smartphone net adds were just over 20,000 in the quarter, compared to about 3,000 a year ago. About 25% of that increase is due to the pickup in gross adds I mentioned earlier, and the other three quarters of the pickup is due to improved churn. We all know churn is usually an outcome of something gone wrong. So we stay very close to our customers. We are constantly measuring customer engagement and adjusting our business practices and services to better meet their needs.\\nOur survey show this strategy is working as customer engagement is moving in the right direction, giving me reason for optimism about our ability to drive handset churn even lower in the future. To strengthen alignment around this customer-focused strategy, we’ve actually made customer engagement a company-wide measurement for success. So in sum, net postpaid customer additions totaled 45,000, up significantly over the 9,000 postpaid net adds generated last year, driven by smartphones and tablets.\\nOur customers overall satisfaction is largely influenced by our network strategy. Last year, we completed our deployment of 4G LTE. It now reaches 99% of all of our postpaid customers, providing an excellent network experience in our suburban and rural markets. Additionally, with multiple 4G roaming agreements now in place, our customers can receive better data experiences as they travel too. Finally, our network team is working toward our first commercial deployment of VoLTE, voice over LTE, early next year.\\nOur device portfolio remains very competitive and we\\'ve seen some strong performance from the new Samsung Galaxy S7. Also, we\\'ve introduced expanded offerings on equipment installment plans which have been well received by our customers, as you can see with the take rate of 69% of postpaid sales to end users in the quarter.\\nGrowing our customer base is not enough, however, we must also capture additional revenue growth. The improvement in our smartphone portfolio and our expanded 4G network has steadily increased postpaid smartphone penetration which now stands at 75% of the postpaid handset base. Although notable progress has been made, we still have an opportunity to drive additional revenue by converting more of our feature phone users to smartphone users.\\nOur shared connect data plans allow us to capitalize on the increasing data consumption, so long as competitive pricing doesn\\'t give away all of that future growth opportunity. Connected devices provide an opportunity to meet the expanding customer needs, while driving store traffic, increasing data usage and revenue per account. At the same time, the more we meet multiple customer needs, the more important our collective services become to our customers and the lower risk we face of customer churn.\\nAs I discussed in February, another strategic priority for 2016 is to reduce unit cost. As has been reported by others in the industry, we are seeing our customers holding on to their devices longer, which resulted in a 7.6% upgrade rate for the quarter. While this is low by historic standards, it is a slight increase from the most recent trend, impacted I believe by the successful launch of the Galaxy S7 to our customer base, which owned a good number of earlier Samsung models.\\nImproved pricing on subsidized handset combined with the EIP higher take rate resulted in a 41% decline in loss on equipment per unit. Another example of our progress in this area would be 11% reduction in general and administrative expenses per average customer and a 7% reduction in systems operation expense per average customer.\\nIn summary, we are off to a solid start, not a great start, not yet reaching aspirational levels but a solid start with improved customer results leading the way.\\nNow let me turn the phone call over to Steve Campbell. Steve?\\nSteve Campbell\\nThank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. I\\'ll begin with a few additional comments on customer results which are shown on Slide 5 of the presentation. As Ken already mentioned, we grew our customer base during the first quarter with 45,000 postpaid net additions, a significant increase from 9,000 net additions a year ago. The growth was driven by positive results in both gross additions, which increased 8% year-over-year to 215,000 in postpaid churn which improved again this quarter to 1.28% compared to 1.48% a year ago.\\nSimilar to the past few quarters, the growth in postpaid net additions was driven by data centric devices like smartphones and connected devices. Together, they accounted for 70,000 net additions. Net handset additions were negative 5000, a significant improvement from negative 31,000 in the prior year, driven by reduced churn. And although total handset net additions were negative 5,000, as Ken discussed earlier, smartphone net additions were positive 20,000, up from only 3,000 a year ago. On top of that, feature phone customers continued to upgrade to smartphones, with the result that total smartphone users increased by 63,000 during the quarter.\\nIn the prepaid category, we had 12,000 net additions, the same level as a year ago. As shown on Slide 6, smartphones represented 92% of total handset sold this quarter, increasing smartphone penetration to 75% of our basic postpaid handset customers, up from 67% a year ago. Based on the levels of smartphone penetration achieved by other carriers, we believe that we still have opportunity to upgrade more of our remaining feature phone customers to smartphones and drive additional data usage revenues.\\nAbout 7.6% of our postpaid customers upgraded their devices this quarter, compared to 6.6% a year ago. This quarter\\'s activity was influenced by the timing of new device launches. Compared to the fourth quarter, which is normally higher due to seasonal activity, this quarter\\'s upgrade rate was down by about 90 basis points.\\nThe next slide shows the longer-term trend in our postpaid churn rate, which is at a historically low level. Postpaid churn has steadily decreased from its peak of 2.29% in the first quarter 2014 to 1.28% for the first quarter of this year.\\nNow let\\'s talk about our financial results. Total operating revenues for the first quarter were $958 million, about the same as last year\\'s $965 million. Service revenues were $760 million, down $68 million or 8% from last year, largely reflecting lower plan pricing due to industry competition and the continued migration to the unsubsidized pricing, meaning the planned discounts that accompany equipment installment plans sales and activations of customer owned equipment. The impact of lower plan pricing was partially offset by the growth in our customer base.\\nEquipment sales revenues grew 45% to $198 million, driven by higher equipment installment plans sales. The percentage of postpaid device sales on installment plans increased to 69% in the first quarter, compared to 53% in the fourth quarter and 41% a year ago. We expect the installment plan take rate to continue to increase over the remainder of this year.\\nPostpaid ARPU, shown on the next slide, was $48.13 for the first quarter, down 12% year-over-year due to price competition and continued migration to unsubsidized pricing. However, this metric excludes equipment installment plan billings to customers. The average billings per user, which includes those billings and provides a better representation of the total amount being collected from customers every month, shows a decrease of 4% year-over-year which is more indicative of the impacts of price competition and the growth in connected devices, which on a per device basis bring lower revenue.\\nThe average revenue per account benefits from the increase in connections per account from 2.47 a year ago to 2.62. For the first quarter, it was $125.36, down 7% year-over-year. But when equipment installment plan billings are included, average billings per account actually increased by 1% year-over-year.\\nWe expect that there will be continuing downward pressure on service revenues as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized pricing, and our equipment sales revenues will continue to grow as the take rate for equipment installment plans increases. Another note is that as different equipment installment plan terms are offered under our accounting practices, the amount of revenue recognized in the period of sale could be affected.\\nOperating cash flow for the quarter, shown next, was in line with our expectations. The success achieved in increasing the level of net additions impacted operating cash flow as expected, when we discussed our annual guidance with you on the year-end call. Therefore when looking at operating cash flow and the year-over-year comparison, remember that this year\\'s number includes the cost of the incremental customer growth that we achieved. Retail gross additions increased by 6% and retail net additions increased from 21,000 to 57,000.\\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $157 million compared to $167 million a year ago. The decrease was largely due to lower revenues as I discussed earlier. Total cash expenses were essentially flat year-over-year with an increase in the cost of equipment sold, offset by reductions in other categories.\\nAdjusted EBITDA shown next incorporates the earnings from our equity method partnerships along with the interest in dividend income, which consist mainly of imputed interest income from equipment installment plans. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $206 million compared to $209 million a year ago.\\nEarnings from unconsolidated entities were $35 million. This included $19 million from the LA partnership, which was relatively flat year-over-year. As we expected, the LA partnership did not make cash distribution in the first quarter. At this time, the amount and timing of future cash distributions are uncertain.\\nNext, I want to cover our guidance for 2016, which is shown on Slide 12 of the presentation. For comparison, we\\'re showing our 2015 results, both as reported and excluding the impact of the termination of the rewards program. The current estimates are unchanged from those provided in February.\\nIn summary, for total operating revenues, we expect a range of approximately $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This reflects our expectation for modest customer growth, additional demand for data and a continued migration through equipment installment plans along with a very competitive pricing environment. For operating cash flow, we expect a range of $525 million to $650 million. The estimate for operating cash flow flows through to the estimated range for adjusted EBITDA which is $725 million to $850 million.\\nTo the extent that we achieve a lower level of customer growth than currently estimated, we would expect results to be in the upper portions of these ranges. On the other hand, to the extent that we are successful on attracting a higher level of customer growth than currently estimated or if the pricing environment worsens, we would expect results to be in the lower portions of the ranges.\\nCapital expenditures are expected to be about $500 million. This lower level of spending compared to 2015 reflects the completion of our 4G LTE deployment. On the other hand, it includes spending to meet higher data demand and to prepare for the initial commercial launch of VoLTE.\\nFinally, I want to make just a couple of comments about U.S. Cellular\\'s cash flows and liquidity. Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter were $163 million, while cash flows used for investing and financing activities totaled $106 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and equivalents of $57 million. As of March 31st, cash and equivalents totaled $772 million. In addition to these existing balances, U.S. Cellular had $202 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility.\\nWe believe that these resources are sufficient to meet our normal operating investment and other debt service requirements for the remainder of this year. However, these resources may not be adequate to fund all future expenditures that we could potentially elect to make, such as purchases of spectrum licenses in the FCC auctions or other acquisitions, and it may be necessary from time to time to increase the size of the existing revolving credit facility, to issue new debt or to obtain other forms of financing in order to fund those expenditures. In that event, accounts receivable under equipment installment plans represent a potential source of financing. At March 31st, the balance of those receivable was $391 million.\\nNow, John Gockley, the company\\'s Vice President, Legal and Regulatory Affairs will provide a brief update on some of our activities in that arena. John?\\nJohn Gockley\\nThank you, Steve and good morning.\\nTurning to Slide 13, this is proving to be a very active year on a regulatory front. Besides this being an election year, the Chairman of the FCC has made it known that he intends \"to run to the finish line\". There are a number of proceedings and issues currently in play which are of keen interest to us and which show signs of being resolved this year.\\nFirst, just last week, the FCC announced at its open meeting, the issuance of a notice of proposed rule-making, proposing a novel approach to the long-standing issue of special access pricing in markets with limited competitive alternatives. The FCC is now proposing to look at the issue on a technologically neutral basis and to examine all providers of both traditional special access circuits and Ethernet facilities and not just incumbent telecos.\\nThe text of the NPRM was released jointly here this week and we are still in the process of reviewing it. We fully expect to be actively involved in those proceedings. The issue of special access pricing has been an open issue at the FCC for way too long, and we view the issuance of this NPRM as a positive development to resolving this issue once and for all. Ethernet backhaul still remains a substantial expense to us and will continue to remain so as consumers continue to consume more and more data services.\\nThe FCC has also launched a proceeding to address the adoption of privacy rules for data services. This proceeding is a logical outgrowth of the decision to re-regulate broadband access as a tied on to common carrier service last year. This is a complicated proceeding with the notice of proposed rule-making keying up over 500 questions or comments. We\\'ve operated under the existing CPNI rules for many years now and we are fully committed to protecting the privacy of our customers.\\nWe ask only of this proceeding that the commission apply a balanced approach that protects customers without adopting onerous operational requirements, which are out of sync with the requirements imposed on other non-common carrier companies who have access in many cases to even more customer data than we do. Of course, we along with the rest of the industry are waiting with great interest to see what the DC Court of Appeals has to say about the FCC\\'s open internal rules, which, depending on what the court does, may have a profound impact on this proceeding.\\nThe FCC recently released its Lifeline Reform Order which will transition the Lifeline program from supporting voice communications to supporting broadband access service over multiple years. Our Lifeline portfolio was a very small part of our business and other than some operational issues associated with the transition, we think that this conversion will have a very little impact on our business. We are currently exploring whether our Lifeline discount apply to data services as contemplated by this order will provide the company with a meaningful opportunity.\\nWe are, however, dubious whether the Lifeline discount of only $9.25 will have much effect on data service subscribership by low income Americans. We would have liked to have seen the FCC entertain a higher discount amount, given that the goal of the program is to drive broadband access subscribership by the most economically challenged Americans higher.\\nLastly is the issue of the future of the Universal Service high cost program, the wireless broadband deployment in rural, unserved and underserved areas of this country. This remains an important issue for the company and for our customers living in rural America. This past February, our Chairman Ted Carlson testified before the Senate Congress Committee about the continuing need for government support for wireless broadband deployment in rural regions and the need for better and more accurate data so that informed decisions could be made about where to deploy facilities and about how much support is necessary to bridge this digital divide.\\nOur Chairman also made note of the profound effect that 5G networks are likely to have on broadband access, and he suggested that funding decisions concerning USF needed to take into account the cost and complexity of bringing 5G networks to rural America. We think his message was very well received.\\nIn fact, recently through the leadership of Senator Joe Manchin, the Senate Congress Committee approved an amendment to the FCC Reauthorization Bill, instructing the FCC to conduct a feasibility study into ways to gather better and more accurate data about the state of wireless broadband deployment in the rural America. We think this proposed law has merit and clearly signals the FCC a concern of reaching important USF decisions based on incomplete data.\\nWe intend to continue to work with Congress and regulators in the design and implementation of a Universal Service Program that will meet our national goals to provide broadband access to rural and urban America alike.\\nVicki?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nThanks, John, and good morning everyone. TDS Telecom\\'s overall results for the first quarter were in line with our expectations. First Wireline revenues declined 2%, which was primarily due to the impacts of the divestitures we completed last year. Adjusting for these effects, Wireline revenues were nearly even with last year.\\nSecond, Cable revenues grew at 3% rate, reflecting growth in both residential and commercial broadband revenues. And third, HMS revenues grew 5%, due primarily to increased equipment sales but also includes growth in reoccurring service revenues.\\nCash expenses increased modestly across all three segments as we continue to position for growth. As a result, adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis declined 4% year-over-year to 76 million.\\nBeginning with Wireline on Slide 16, our investments on our network in efforts to make higher speed options available to customers continue to drive growth in IPTV connections. We also continued to see increases in the take rate on 10 megabits and higher broadband products. In the first quarter, we rolled out one new IPTV market. We\\'ve now launched TDS TV in 28 markets and enabled 174,000 service addresses for IPTV service.\\nWe are completing our planned fiber build to reach approximately 21% of our ILEC service addresses. And when combined with copper service, our IPTV enabled markets cover approximately 25% of our service addresses. For the reminder of the year, we will focus on driving IPTV high-speed broadband bundle in these markets.\\nTo further strengthen our broadband offerings, we are deploying bonding technology to an additional one-third of our ILEC service addresses, to drive higher speeds in our middle tier ILEC copper markets. In our remaining markets, we are evaluating the FCC\\'s modified universal service funding mechanism to support broadband build out.\\nUnder this modified USF mechanism announced in March 30th, the FCC is providing greater return carriers with two paths to receive funds. The first path includes a voluntary model-based approach, which we could elect on a state-by-state level and includes a fixed amount of support for a 10-year period in exchange for meeting defined build out obligations for broadband services.\\nThe second path is based on existing rate of return mechanisms, from which we receive support today, but will carry substantial modifications going forward, including a reduction in the allowed rate of return, the elimination of support in competitive areas and defined build-out obligations. In general, we are pleased with many aspects of the order and are carefully evaluating our options under the two paths.\\nNow looking at the metrics from the bottom of the slide, IPTV connections grew 50%, adding 12,800 subscribers compared to the prior year. And we added 2,800 broadband connections excluding divestitures. We are offering a variety of speeds up to 1 gigabits service in all IPTV markets. The uptick on IPTV has grown steadily and is now at an average penetration rate of 28%.\\nIt is important to remember 97% of our IPTV customers take all three services, which results in a low churn rate and drove an increase in average revenue per connection up to $43.28 in the quarter.\\nReflecting both our fiber and bonded cooper deployments, residential broadband customers are continuing to choose higher speeds in our ILEC market, with 49% choosing speed of 10 megabits or greater and 18% choosing speed of 25 megabits or greater which also contribute to the higher ARPU.\\nLooking at Slide 17, Wireline results were mildly impacted by ILEC divestitures. While I\\'m going to give you the actual results as presented, on a same-store basis we were a bit stronger. Residential revenues increased 2% as growth in broadband and IPTV more than offset the decline in our legacy voice services. The year-over-year decrease in ILEC residential voice connections has held at about 3% over the past seven quarters excluding divestitures.\\nCommercial revenues decreased 4% and high margin wholesale revenues decreased 5% this quarter. On a combined basis, total Wireline revenues declined 2% to $173 million. Wireline cash expenses increased 2% as increases in employee related expenses and IPTV content cost outpaced the reduced cost of provisioning legacy services. As a result, Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased $5 million or 8%.\\nSlide 18, cable connections growth. Total cable connections grew 5% to 284,000. On the residential side connections increased, driven by 8% growth in broadband and a 23% growth in voice. This growth more than offset the continued declines in video connections. The residential broadband subscriber growth drove a 200 basis point increase in broadband penetration. While total commercial connections were flat, broadband connections grew 14%.\\nOn Slide 19, you can see total revenues increased for Cable 3% to $45 million, Residential revenues increased 1% as higher promotional offerings offset the connections growth. Commercial revenues increased 10%, primarily as a result of price increases through video. Cash expenses increased 6% as higher programming cost and property taxes were offset by cost synergies achieved from the acquisition synergies we are seeing. As a result Cable adjusted EBITDA remained relatively flat.\\nTurning to the HMS segment and speaking from both Slides 20 and 21, the HMS business remained focused on growing reoccurring service revenues. Our hosting service revenues grew 2% for the quarter. Last year we invested in building data center space and we are focused on selling across our portfolio of services, which will utilize available data center capacity and increase revenues without requiring significant capital investment in 2016.\\nEquipment sales improved $2 million due to the higher spending by existing customers. Cash expenses were up 2% compared to the same period in the prior year, which mainly reflects higher cost of itself to support equipment sales. Other operating expenses were down as reductions in employee expense has had a meaningful impact. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA increasing by $2 million.\\nWe have provide our guidance for 2016 on Slide 22, which is unchanged from the guidance we shared in February. I will remind you that these numbers do not include considerations for the impact of FCC USF reform order. Overall, we are pleased with the results of the Telecom\\'s first quarter and we\\'ll continue to update you on a successful execution of our strategic priorities throughout the year.\\nNow, I\\'ll turn the call back over Jane.\\nJane McCahon\\nThanks, Vicki. And operator, we\\'re ready to take questions. I\\'ll let folks know we have other people in the room, Kevin Hess, Telecom SVP responsible for Government and Regulatory Affairs; Doug Shuma, Corporate SVP of Finance and others are in the room with us. So, Melissa [ph], we\\'ll take our first question.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\\nRic Prentiss\\nThanks, good morning.\\nKen Meyers\\nHey, Ric.\\nJane McCahon\\nMorning, Ric.\\nRic Prentiss\\nHey, let\\'s start with U.S. Cellular, Ken, as we think about this quarter versus last year, last year the growth was not as significant, so on the short-term basis, EBITDA and operating cash flow did a little better. This quarter more investment for the long-term you\\'re seeing the growth, so what I\\'d like to kind of get at with the question is as you think about the guidance, what level of gross adds should we be expecting for that to hit the high end or the low end? Because obviously you\\'re seeing 15% growth -- or I\\'d say it was 8% growth in the gross adds on the quarter was significant compared to last year. I mean gross adds over the year were down 15% versus 14%.\\nKen Meyers\\nYes, Ric, that thing is exactly the one that we grappled with as we established guidance for the year. From a strategic standpoint, I want -- it is necessary for us to continue to grow the customer base, that is both by some of the marketing programs like I talked about in the SMB area, it\\'s about driving gross adds and it\\'s also about driving down churn. Both of those on the one end have cost involved with them, and so when we put together our guidance there, we talked about how we were going to use promotional activity that if it was successful, would manifest itself in operating expenses and higher adds. But because it was promotional, it wasn\\'t as successful. You\\'d have less expense, more cash flow but not the adds. The first quarter -- this is just what we wanted it to do. We got off to a nice fast start and our objective is to continue to build on that. Our objective is to continue to grow the base, which is why the cash flow guidance, as an example, is where we put it for the year. The most successful year will have us growing the base and continuing to invest cash flow and staying within the guide, which is why we reiterated it, and we\\'re reiterating it today, we aren\\'t changing it. So if the market turns soft, right, we will have less adds and we\\'ll just see more cash flow coming to the bottom line.\\nRic Prentiss\\nRight. So should we expect gross adds kind of at a similar year-over-year level, as I\\'m thinking of that, if you\\'re successful growing the business, it would be kind of similar to the first quarter in general?\\nKen Meyers\\nIt could be.\\nRic Prentiss\\nOkay, also you mentioned optimistic handset churn to go even lower, one item spread recently when they reported did start breaking out handset churn from other churn, so hopefully you can kind of continue to give us maybe that extra data point on what handset churn is. I assume there\\'s not much tablet churn in the current timeframe though?\\nKen Meyers\\nNot much, but in fact our handset churn is lower or better than tablet churn, but both of them are important products and we continue to see very good customer retention across all of the supply line. In fact, the one we haven\\'t talked about, prepaid actually showed some really nice improvement in churn year-over-year also.\\nRic Prentiss\\nOkay. And then EIP if I understood Steve\\'s comment right, you expect EIP to actually increase through the remainder of the year, what level of EIP do you think we could reach as we look at customers liking this type of plan?\\nKen Meyers\\nWell, we can look at what others have done and see rates meaningfully above where we\\'re running, but understand our marketing strategy is not to drive EIP for EIP sake but rather to make sure that we\\'ve got the right products and services in the market for our customers and to make sure that either one of them, or all of them rather, are profitable for the business. So customers that want a subsidized model, we want to make sure that we\\'ve got an offering that works for them as well as an EIP offering that works for those that want that. So it\\'s an outcome, it\\'s not a target. So I don\\'t sit there and say, gee, we want more or less of this. What we want is the right products in the marketplace for our customers. So could it go higher? It absolutely could. It did go up to 80%. We\\'ve seen that in other places, but that\\'s not a target, it’s an outcome.\\nRic Prentiss\\nOkay. And then finally, just one question, I swear, so the other piece of it clearly is upgrades, industry level upgrades where we\\'re fairly light this quarter. You touched on the Samsung Galaxy S7 was a bigger exposure to you, but as we think about your guidance and comparing it to the rest of the industry, where are your thoughts as far as what upgrade levels would look like this year?\\nKen Meyers\\nWhen you think about upgrade rates, and this quarter it\\'s about 7, 7.6% and that\\'s lower than the fourth quarter, lower than the third quarter, and it\\'s lower than the second quarter of last year. It was above first quarter of last year. And when we look at it year-over-year one of the, I think, drivers to that was the success around the Galaxy 7. If you think about our customer base, we lost customers in the past because we didn\\'t have an iPhone in the portfolio. And as a result, I think it\\'s the distribution of our customers, we have a customer base that likes Android and is very, very happy with the Samsung devices. And given where we\\'ve had successful launches in the past, first quarter, the five two years ago, are at the end of their two-year contract, and now with EIP last year rolling out and is in the upgrade twelve months, we had a base that was waiting for this and we had a very successful [indiscernible]. We are targeting a lower upgrade rate, but again, it\\'s about making sure the programs that we put in place work economically for us until we see -- we\\'re seeing nothing to suggest we\\'re going to be running higher all year, but it was successful first quarter with the Galaxy product.\\nRic Prentiss\\nGreat, thanks. I\\'ll see you guys later next week.\\nKen Meyers\\nOkay. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.\\nPhil Cusick\\nHey, guys, thanks. I guess first on the Wireline side, can you talk about the HMS strategy. It seems like the growth isn\\'t coming through the other way that we\\'d hope. How is that strategy coming together?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nSure. This is Vicki. As you think about HMS, HMS is really still a very important part of our growth strategy. And as you know, we\\'ve been very focused on integrating our five businesses that we acquired and going through and standardizing the processes and systems and trying to drive that reoccurring revenue growth. I think we continue to make progress, but we still have more work to do. And as we see clear progress, we\\'ll begin to set more milestones on around that reoccurring revenue growth. We saw nice growth overall, 5%, but as you know we want that to be higher.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay. And on the Cable side, sort of the same question, should we look for revenue to be growing here or is the offsetting of subscribers and ARPU sort of trailing off?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nYou know, as we said in our guidance for 2016, we\\'re really focused on looking for mid-single digit revenue growth. And in the first quarter, I reported 3%. If you adjust for an accounting adjustment, it was really running about 4%. We are running heavy promotions that are driving that really strong growth that you saw in broadband connections, and we\\'ll continue to monitor that growth throughout the year. But yes, we’re looking for mid-single digit growth which is meeting our expectations.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay. One for Ken, I think a lot of people expect or sort of understand that revenue per user on the postpaid side will come down, but it was pretty violent this quarter, anything one-time in there that we should be thinking about?\\nKen Meyers\\nNo, nothing is violent, I think, here for us. In terms of when we launched the EIP offering combined with the impact of tablets, when you think about your mix, you get a lot of noise in that. When we look at revenue per account continuing to grow, and we\\'ve low pricing stuff in the industry too, but it\\'s really right in line where we\\'re kind of expecting it right now, Phil. No one-timers in there.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay. So that 48 is the right level and probably down from there as we continue the mix?\\nKen Meyers\\nI think that there is still, from a service revenue standpoint, the still risk is that EIP kind of take rate keeps bouncing around.\\nPhil Cusick\\nGot it. And can you give us an update on your wireless roaming, both inbound and outbound?\\nKen Meyers\\nYes, so we\\'ve got 4G agreements now in place with three out of the four larger entities. We\\'ve got it launched with one of them already and working with others. Roaming revenue itself is, I\\'d call it modest, with that moving around a lot down a little bit year-over-year because of the pricing agreement entered into last year but roaming cost actually down even more year-over-year. So still continuing to manage that business pretty effectively. And importantly, as I think about it, it\\'s the roll out of voice over LTE that would start to turn on next year, that turns that into a growth opportunity, because suddenly we’ll be able to serve customers from every carrier versus just the CDMA based carriers that we serve today.\\nPhil Cusick\\nGot it. Thanks guys.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\\nSimon Flannery\\nThank you very much. Looking at the ARPU on the postpaid side, obviously the EIP transition is impacting that, can you give us a sense of what the sort of average EIP customer is paying in terms of ARPU as we get a sense of how that transition is working? And then any updates on the M&A environment over on the TDS Telecom side? Thanks.\\nKen Meyers\\nSimon, it\\'s Ken. I don\\'t have in front of me something that\\'s look at average revenue just on EIP account, so we can follow up with you, but I don\\'t have that in the room right now.\\nSimon Flannery\\nI can look at it. Something Verizon sort of talked about was when they expect service revenue to decline or to just sort of moderate, is that something you see in the next few quarters here as you make up to 50% EIP?\\nKen Meyers\\nI understand the math in that. I think you\\'ve got -- as I said, there\\'s three component that are, as I think about, washing through average revenue per unit. One of those components is the EIP mix, one of them is the product mix, as between handsets and other connected devices. And then there is just the industry noise around pricing. Yes, as you stabilize the EIP mix, that piece of it will moderate, but you still have an ongoing mix within the industry as more connected devices get added in there or as customers continue to hold units longer and get -- bring in their own equipment and wind up with discount. So there is room around that one metric. But that metric again is an outcome and that\\'s something that individually gets driven and rather helps understand what\\'s going on within the business.\\nSimon Flannery\\nThank you.\\nVicki Villacrez\\nAnd from the M&A side, on the Telecom side of the house, we continue to evaluate potential cable acquisitions. We continue to stay focused on that. As you know, I can\\'t comment on any specific transaction until a definitive agreement is in place, but we\\'re looking at acquisitions that meet our criteria which again is around looking at our competitive and demographic criteria that we\\'ve shared before in the past.\\nAnd then again, from an HMS perspective, you know, we are making progress as I said in my earlier answer, and we have had a strong start to the year in terms of sales. And I really look for that to translate into higher revenue growth in the second half of the year. And as we continue to perform and meet our milestones, we may look at smaller acquisitions in addition to the generation of organic growth in that business. But that would a longer term initiative.\\nSimon Flannery\\nThat\\'s helpful. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sergey Dluzhevskiy with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nGood morning guys. A couple of questions if I could. So, first question, kind of a big picture question for Ken and Doug, so U.S. Cellular obviously has been turning around subscriber growth or so over the few quarters, but arguably investors have remained unimpressed including this morning. So in your opinion, what are investors missing in the investment story for U.S. and GDS? And what are the main building blocks in your opinion maybe you could reiterate for enhancing shareholder value in the near term and also in the long term?\\nKen Meyers\\nSergey, it\\'s Ken, let me just start with that. Up until few hours ago when the markets opened, I felt we were marching right down that path. I looked at what we produced for the quarter, what we produced relative to our guidance, what we produced relative to consensus and we\\'re really happy with where we started. The fact that we\\'ve got some part of our base that\\'s looking for something different, I can only deliver on what I\\'ve kind of set out as our strategy. And our strategy is to continue to improve our local market position, continue to strengthen the company, grow revenues and grow cash flows. And I don\\'t see anything else on the short-term horizon that\\'s going to either change our strategy or change our trajectory.\\nDoug Shuma\\nAnd, Sergey, I\\'ll just reiterate what Ken said, we\\'re pleased with the progress that U.S. Cellular has been making. It doesn\\'t come overnight. We\\'re committed to helping them be successful and at some point whether the shareholders recognize that or not, we think they will. We don\\'t have any imminent transactions engineering type things that would drive any immediate shareholder excitement if you will but we\\'re committed to U.S. Cellular.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nOkay. And a question -- another question for Ken. This is kind of relates to financial engineering or just looking at the asset base that you guys have. So, obviously you have a logical tower portfolio and you have been very clear that you’re not interested in monetizing the value of this portfolio, it\\'s core to your business. But could you share your thoughts as you look at your portfolio now and [indiscernible], what are your thoughts on making those as a value and contribution from this tower portfolio within the context of U.S. Cellular strategy so that it would be more adequately reflected in your share price?\\nKen Meyers\\nSergey, great question. As you so aptly put it, strategic asset. It\\'s important to us. It is critical as we continue to evolve our network and it\\'s critical especially given some of the -- I\\'ll call it games some of the tower companies are starting to play in terms of trying to extract more value out of their assets from their perspective of being a landlord. And so having a large portion of our towers that we own, and not subject to those pressures is important.\\nSecondly, we continue to lease out our asset. If I look at it kind of on a same-store basis or comparable basis, year-over-year basis, our tower rentals are up 10, about 11% year-over-year. And so we will continue to capture as much value as we can in the marketplace off of those assets, while retaining the strategic control we need so that we can continue to evolve our networks. And it\\'s amazing how we\\'re just finishing out 4G, we\\'re about to embark on voice over LTE which will require more modifications and people are already testing 5G, right? Well, you know, that\\'s going to put more strain on those very assets or increase their value even more in the future.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nRight. And last question for Doug, I mean given the relativity of the stock price and also kind of given your outlook maybe for the environment in cable space, how should we think about your appetite for buybacks this year and just in general?\\nDoug Shuma\\nYes, Sergey, I\\'m going to stick to the old answer to that. We\\'re committed to our investment strategy of, for every $3 we invest in the business, returning $1 to the shareholders over the long term and I think you\\'ll see that play out this year as well.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\\nJennifer Fritzsche\\nGreat. Thank you. Two if I may, I wanted to ask first on VoLTE, can you mention next year, it\\'s my understanding that for the CDMA player, it\\'s a harder path to VoLTE, which might explain why some of the GSM players are ahead of, like Verizon? And then wondering if you\\'re finding that as well that, maybe more technical question. And then secondly if I could ask about the competitive environment. We are -- C&T Mobile laid up a lot of this A block spectrum and get into more secondary market. Are you seeing any impact directly from them? Or is that -- it\\'s really not evidenced in the churn, but I wanted to ask the question, are you seeing still more either ET&T and Verizon as being the main competitors?\\nKen Meyers\\nGood morning, Jennifer. Thanks for the question. First of all, with respect to VoLTE, yes, there is a pretty well documented fact that the coverage on the voice side with CDMA is a wonderful, wonderful product. And when you\\'ve built your network with that product and you then try to overlay voice over LTE in the same cell site, there is an initiate coverage what I\\'d call gap almost. And it\\'s something that we saw in the tests that we ran last year, and it\\'s something that our deployment schedule has been built around in order to eliminate it. And there are various techniques our engineers are using such as moving equipment to the top of the towers which gets back to having control over those towers, so you can move your equipment when and where you need it. And they\\'re using other engineering tools so that when we do turn on VoLTE, we are able to deliver our customers the same and better services that they\\'re getting now. So that\\'s why we haven\\'t been rushing to it, wouldn\\'t be very deliberate and proceed with caution, like we have in every other technology change in the past.\\nAround your A block question, our primary competitors in our market are Verizon and AT&T in that order, and it\\'s based upon which of them has the original cellular license in that market, which allows us to have one of them and Verizon or AT&T and the other to really on an economical basis build out a very vibrant coverage area. That 700 have some of the very similar characteristics. And so we\\'ve heard about other carriers trying to build up their 700\\'s and increase their kind of competitive footprint. But particular to the question you asked about T-Mobile, they’re building out to my understanding the 700 A block, and we\\'ve been successful in most of our markets acquiring that 700 A block. So if we own it, they don\\'t own it.\\nJennifer Fritzsche\\nOkay.\\nKen Meyers\\nAnd we\\'re seeing them in a couple of markets but the most part they\\'re building out in markets around us, near us, and as we get to us turning on VoLTE, looking forward to be able to serve their customers as they roam into our markets.\\nJennifer Fritzsche\\nGreat. Thanks, Ken.\\nJane McCahon\\nWe\\'ve time for one more question operator.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Group. Please proceed with your question.\\nMichael Rollins\\nHi, thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. Just a couple if I could, you know the first is just going back to the topic of ARPU, can you specifically disclose the performance of phone ARPU in its totality? And maybe just help us a little bit more on the bridge of contributing factors to ARPU performance during the quarter. I know you\\'ve given us a lot of commentary on the call to think about. I was just wondering you could put some more numbers to that. And then, you know, secondly, over time I think the management team has talked about the importance of being able to grow the top-line. And is there a timeframe over which investor could keep in mind in terms of when you\\'ll be able to answer that question as you get through the EIP migration and continue to contemplate the competitive landscape? Is that a 12-month observation period, 24-month observation period, any thoughts on that duration over which the answer should become more clear? Thanks.\\nKen Meyers\\nHey, Mike, that\\'s a couple of things. So, one, as I\\'ll look at -- I don\\'t have the information as I am sitting and talking to you now the bridge is one of the other talks about one component of the -- our revenue or not, we\\'ll look and see it, what might be in the corners of all of our other analysis. But I don\\'t have any of those here right now.\\nOn the timeframe, there isn\\'t a drop date. I think Doug talked about how we\\'re committed to this business. We continue to grow the customer base which is the precursor to growing the revenue. We also talked the work we\\'re doing around roaming. I\\'ve not talked about the work we\\'re doing around advertising. There are many different specs and logs kind of on the fire, the thing that we’re all working to drive revenue which is the key metric in any long term sustainable business. But I don\\'t have a drop dead date to give you.\\nMichael Rollins\\nThanks very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Ms. McCahon, there are no further questions. I\\'d like to turn the floor back to you for any final remarks.\\nJane McCahon\\nOkay. We\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us this morning and we\\'re available for questions throughout the day and we\\'ll probably see some of you next week. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. This concludes today\\'s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.',\n",

    "Greetings, and welcome to the TDS and U.S. Cellular Second Quarter Operating Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Jane McCahon, Senior Vice President, Corporate Relations at TDS. Thank you, Ms. McCahon, please begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jane McCahon\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, Tim. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want to make you all aware of the presentation we have prepared to accompany our comments this morning, which you'll find on the Investor Relations sections of the TDS and U.S. Cellular websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "With me today and offering prepared comments are from U.S. Cellular, Ken Meyers, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and from TDS Telecom, Vicki Villacrez, Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This call is being simultaneously webcast on the TDS and U.S. Cellular Investor Relations websites. Please see the websites for slides referred to on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. As a reminder, we provide guidance for both operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. For TDS Telecom, these are basically the same number. For U.S. Cellular, however, the adjusted EBITDA measure includes imputed interest income from EIP and significant contributions from our partnership, which we want to continue to highlight for investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information set forth in the presentation and discussed during this call contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Please review the Safe Harbor paragraph in our press releases and the extended version in our SEC filings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned on our previous calls, U.S. Cellular filed a short form application for the upcoming forward [ph] auction for 600 megahertz spectrum known as Auction 1002. As the anti-collusion rules are now in effect, we are prohibited from speaking about it further, therefore we will not entertaining any other questions relating to spectrum of the auction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after we released our earnings and before the call, TDS and U.S. Cellular filed their SEC forms 8-K, including today's press releases and their Form 10-Qs. Of note, in our 10-Qs we are now breaking out postpaid churn between handset and connected devices. TDS will be presenting at the Drexel Hamilton Conference in New York on September 7 and we're hosting analysts meetings at CTIA, in Las Vegas on September 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "And please keep in mind that we do have an open door policy. So if you're ever in the Chicago area and would like to meet with members of management, the IR team will try to accommodate you, calendar's permitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Meyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Good morning. I'll start with Slide 4. We're now halfway through the year and continuing to move forward. Our result reflects steady progress across multiple fronts. Smartphones and connected devices are growing, customer engagement continues to improve, the current network is performing well and our first voice over LTE build out is on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's go little deeper starting with customer growth, our top priority. We are moving forward but still not at the pace I'd like to see. That's probably not surprising given the low churn rates we've seen across the industry and overall consumer weakness. We are having continued success with connected devices primarily tablets. Both gross and net additions are increasing and postpaid connections per account. A share of wallet metric was up 6%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Net postpaid additions were more than twice than at last year at 36,000 once again driven by tablets and smartphones offset by the loss of feature phones. We continue to see good progress from our increased focus on small and medium-sized businesses in regional government entities. Handset growth adds for this segment continued to grow and our M10 [ph] sales are gaining momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an organization, we're constantly measuring our customer satisfaction and adjusting our business practices and offerings to better meet their needs. Our survey showed this strategy is working is evidenced by our improving engagement scores in churn. I'm particularly encouraged by our continued improvement in postpaid churn 1.2% in the quarter, a record low for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Jane mentioned in response to investor and analyst request, we've also begun to breakout postpaid handset and connected device churn, which at 1.10% and 1.84% also showed significant improvement from year ago. Our customers overall satisfaction is largely influenced by our network strategy. Last year, we completed our deployment of 4G LTE. It now reached 99% of our postpaid connections and today it's carrying almost 90% of all of our data traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, three 4G roaming agreements are in place, so our customers are now receiving better data experiences as they travel. Finally, so I said our network team is on track to launch our first commercial deployment of Voice over LTE early next year. I think it's important to note, the inflection point we've reached with our roaming agreements. This year, is one of significant transition as we move from 3G CDMA agreements to 4G LTE agreements to significantly lower the price per gigabit, both from revenue and expense point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also our remarkably talented engineering group has lead the way in implementing technology that allows for data roaming and one network, with a fallback to another carrier for voice services. This will open up the door first provide data roaming to more than just CDMA based carriers and allows to better manage the quality of our customers roaming experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spend a few moments on revenue trends, overall total revenue growth is just about where we thought it would be. Service revenues are down due to multiple forces. Some of which are accounting our income statement geography, some of which are more real. First and largest, we have the impacted EIP adoptions which have the effect of moving service revenue to the equipment line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also we have the still early but developing trend at the customer keeping equipment longer or bringing equipment with them and finally the ongoing soft pricing environment industry. These three factors combined to more than offset the positive impacts on service revenue of smartphone adoption which was now 77% of the postpaid handset base and our growth in prepaid and connected devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within EIP take rate of 69% in the quarter, our EIP penetration continues to grow rapidly and now is at 37% as compared to 20% a year ago. Of note, I'd also highlight that we have steadily improved the number of connections per account resulting in a year-over-year increase in average billings per account. Steve will provide more detail on these trends in a moment. But first let me lean into or perhaps share a new or different ways to think about upgrade rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, a lot of attention has been paid to upgrade rates because in a subsidized handset business model every time a customer wanted to move or upgrade to a new handset, the carrier would lose hundreds of dollars on the transaction and the customer signed a new contract. This upgrade rate was a metric that explained part of the equipment purchased [ph] each quarter, lower the upgrade rates improve the P&L. Conversely, increase the upgrade rate and negatively impact the P&L. We saw this a few years back as we transitioned off of rewards points, as a way to build customers stickiness and move back to contracts and headquarters of upgrade rates and the teams of the obvious P&L hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not talked about or at least not talked about as much was a positive that came with us, which was more of a carrier's customer [ph] base was under contracts. In today's EIP driven business model, we've dramatically changed the economics of equipment transaction and now I look at this metric quite differently. With the P&L impact of upgrades dramatically reduced I look at renewal rates and the percent of base under contract as indicators of customer satisfaction and with 81% of our postpaid customer base under contract with us at the end of the quarter. I'm quite comfortable with where our renewal rate was this quarter, especially in light of all the anticipation it builds every time another iconic device launch approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of which, we will be ready to compete aggressively during the iPhone launch. We know there are still many non-U.S. Cellular customers out there that are still unaware that we carry Apple products. So we will be looking to increase that awareness and win their business. In summary, we've been making steady progress over the first half of the year and I expect to continue to move forward on our priorities during the second half.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now, let me turn the call over to Steve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steve Campbell\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, Ken and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments with a few additional things to say about customer results shown on Slide 5 of the presentation. As Ken already mentioned, we grew connections during the second quarter with 36,000 postpaid net additions, a solid increase from 17,000 net additions a year ago. Growth was driven by positive results in both postpaid gross additions which increased 3% year-over-year to 197,000 and postpaid churn which improved again this quarter to 1.2% compared to 1.34% a year ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the past few quarters the growth in postpaid net additions was driven by data centric devices like smartphones and connected devices, together they accounted for 57,000 net additions. In the prepaid category, we had 14,000 net additions, an increase from a year ago driven by the success of our new Simple Connect plans sold through our company and agent stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown at the bottom of this slide, postpaid handset net additions were negative 13,000 an improvement from negative 19,000 in the prior year driven by reduced churn. However, although overall handset net additions were negative smartphone net additions were positive 8,000. Further when upgrades from feature phones are included total smartphone connections increased by 46,000 during the second quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're providing more information about the smartphones on the next slide. Smartphones represented 91% of total handsets sold this quarter and smartphone penetration increased to 77% of our base of postpaid handset connections up from 69% a year ago. We believe that we still have some opportunity to upgrade more of our remaining feature phone customers to smartphones and drive additional data usage revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next slide shows the longer term trend in our postpaid churn rate, which at 1.2% for the second quarter is at a historically low level. Now let's talk about our financial results starting with revenues. Total operating revenues for the second quarter were $980 million about the same as last year's $976 million. The small improvement in revenues reverses the trend of the last couple quarters when revenues declined both sequentially and year-over-year.\n",
    "\n",
    "However as we look ahead, I need to remind you that last year's third quarter had a one-time bump up in revenue due to the elimination of the reward points program and we won't have another event like that, this quarter. Service revenues were $762 million down $62 million from $824 million last year. The largest component of service revenues retail service at $680 million decreased by 8% driven by lower average revenue per user. But this decrease in our pool was partially offset by the impact of growth in our customer base.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll come back and say more about ARPU in a minute. The other item contributing to the reduction in service revenues was lower, roaming which declined by $11 million or 23% primarily due to lower rates for data usage. Keep in mind that we benefit from lower rates on our outbound roaming traffic. Total expense for outbound roaming decreased by 11% year-over-year with lower rates offsetting a significant increase in data usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equipment sales revenue grew 44% to $218 million driven by higher equipment installment plan sales. Percentage of postpaid device sales on installment plans increased to 69% in the second quarter, compared to 44% a year ago. We do expect the installment plan take rate to continue to increase over the course of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I want to say a few words about our postpaid average revenue metrics. Postpaid ARPU was $47.37 for the second quarter, down 12% year-over-year. Most of this decline is driven by the continued migration to unsubsidized equipment pricing. Other factors include overall industry price competition and the growth in connected devices, which have lower average revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the ARPU metric excludes equipment installment plan billings to customers another metric which includes those billings average billings per user may provide a better representation of the total amount of revenue being collected from customers every month. Reported this way, the average revenue shows a decrease of 3% year-over-year with about half of that decrease estimated to be, the dilution from connected devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average revenue per account benefits from the increase in connection per account which grew by 6%. For the second quarter, the average revenue per account was $124.91 down 7% year-over-year, but when equipment installment plan billings are included the average billings per account actually increased by 2% year-over-year. We expect that there will be continuing downward pressure on service revenues, but the equipment sales revenues will continue to grow as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized equipment pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating cash flow for the quarter, shown next was in line with our expectations. Operating cash flow was $168 million compared to $162 million a year ago. Total cash expenses were essentially flat year-over-year with an increase in the cost of equipment driven by 6% higher volume offset by reductions in other cost categories. When looking at operating cash flow and the year-over-year comparison remember that this year's number includes the cost of the incremental customer growth that, we achieved. Retail gross additions increased by 5% and net additions increased from 25,000 to 50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted EBITDA shown on the next slide incorporates the earnings from our equity method partnerships along with interest in dividend income which consist mainly of imputed interest income from our equipment installment plants. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $218 million compared to $207 million a year ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earnings from unconsolidated entities were $37 million and this includes $20 million from the Los Angeles partnership, a slight increase from the year ago. Next I want to cover our annual guidance for 2016 which is shown on Slide 12 of the presentation. For comparison, we're showing our 2015 results both as reported and excluding the impact of the termination of the rewards programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current estimates for the year are unchanged from those provided initially in February and confirmed in May, I'll quickly review them. For total operating revenues, we expect range of approximately $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This reflects our continuing expectation for modest customer growth additional demand for data and increased adoption of equipment installment plans along with very competitive pricing environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is clearly uncertainty related of the impact of the new iPhone launch this fall, along with the normal uncertainty related to the holiday selling season. For operating cash flow we expect the range of $525 million to $650 million, that estimate also flows through to the estimated range for adjusted EBITDA which is $725 million to $850 million. To the extent that we achieve a lower level of customer growth and currently estimated, we would expect results to be in the upper portion of the ranges. On the other hand to the extent that we're successful in attracting higher level of customer growth than currently estimated or if the pricing environment worsens. We would expect results to be in the lower portion than the ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital expenditures are expected to be about $500 million. This lower level of spending compared to 2015 reflects the completion of our 4G LTE deployment. It includes spending to meet higher data demand and to prepare for the initial commercial launch of Voice over LTE. I want to make just a couple of comments about U.S. Cellular's cash flows and liquidity. Cash flows from operating activities for the first six months of 2016 were $261 million while cash flows used for investing and financing activities totaled $355 million resulting in a net decrease in cash and equivalents with $94 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of June 30, cash and equivalents totaled $621 million, in addition to these existing balances U.S. Cellular has $283 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. We believe that these resources are sufficient to meet our operating investment and debt service requirements for the remainder of this year. Recall that the company has a 5.5% interest in the Los Angeles partnership and that the partnership had suspended cash distributions to the partners beginning in 2015 in connection with the purchase of spectrum license in FCC Auction 97.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were notified recently by the general partner, the note payable related to the license purchase will be completely repaid by June 30 and that cash distribution will be made in the third quarter of 2016. U.S. Cellular received a distribution of $9.6 million on July 28.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to wrap up the discussion of U.S. Cellular, I'll just reiterate what Ken said earlier. Overall, we've made steady progress over the first half of the year which results in line with our expectations and we're confident that we can continue to move forward on our priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Vicki Villacrez to discuss TDS Telecom. Vicki?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, thank you Steve and good morning, everyone. TDS Telecom's overall results for the second quarter showed improvement over the first quarter as revenues strengthened in all three segments. First, Wireline revenues were nearly even with last year and it's adjusted for divestiture showed positive growth with a 5% increase in residential revenues. Second, Cable revenues grew 2% over the last year reflecting another quarter of strong broad brand subscriber growth of 12%. And third, HMS revenues grew 6% due to strong service revenue growth as well as increased equipment sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we continue to seek growth cash expenses increased in line with those revenues. As a result, adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis remains relatively flat at $80 million for the quarter. Our financial results are reflecting the successful execution of our strategy, as revenues for new products and services are offsetting declines in our legacy voice offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are halfway through the year and we are tracking against our expectations. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on those strategic priorities that we shared with you on February which will be highlighted in the coming slides. Beginning with Wireline on Slide 15, our investments and our network and efforts to make higher speed options available to customer continued to drag growth in IPTV connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "We completed our planned IPTV market roll out last quarter, but continued to build out service in those 28 markets now enabling 180,000 service addresses. We are completing our planned fiber builds which will reach approximately 21% of our ILEC service addresses. And when combined with copper service, our IPTV enabled markets will cover approximately 25% of our total ILEC service addresses. For the reminder of the year, we will focus on further driving IPTV and high-speed broadband bundles in these markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further strengthen our broadband offerings, we are deploying bonding technology up to an additional 30% of our ILEC service addresses, in order to drive higher data speeds in our middle-tier ILEC copper markets. In our remaining markets, we are evaluating the FCC's modified universal service funding mechanism to support broadband build out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, that the FCC announced, a modified USF mechanism that is providing greater return carriers with two paths to receive support funds, to extend broadband services to un-served and underserved areas. TDS will need to make a decision on which support action it will elect, an alternative to connect to American Cost Models, which is commonly known as A-CAM or revised USS mechanism to say on greater returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for us to make this termination, the FCC needed to finalize the amount of support that TDS would get if we elected the A-CAM path. We've just received the offer from the FCC which was made public this week. We are very pleased with the offer for $82.3 million of support revenue annual for 10 years. As it helps us provides a better, faster, broadband service to our most rural customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally will be provided funding for transition in the early years in certain states. This support comes with an obligation to build defined broadband speed to reach approximately 159,600 homes which will require a significant capital investment over a 10-year period. We have 90 days to make our decision to accept the FCC offer at which times the FCC may under certain circumstances revise their offer and we would have another 30 days to respond. The FCC's goal is to make this program effective January 1, 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the metrics on the bottom of the slide. IPTV connections grew nearly 50% adding 13,300 compared to the prior year and we added 2,800 broadband connections excluding divestures. We are offering a variety of speeds up to 1 Gig service in all our IPTV markets. The uptick in IPTV has grown steadily and is now in an average penetration rate of almost 30% of residential service addresses. It is important to remember that 97% of our IPTV customers, subscribe to a triple play bundle which results in a low churn rate and continues to increase average revenues per connection, which is now up 4% to $43.67 in the quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflecting both our fiber and bonded copper deployments, residential broadband customers in these ILEC markets are continuing to choose higher speeds with 50% choosing speed of 10 megabits or greater and 19% choosing speeds of 25 megabits or greater. This will also contribute to the higher ARPUs we've been experiencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at Slide 16, Wireline results were solid even with 2015 ILEC divestitures which reduced revenues and expenses about 1%. As reported residential revenues increased 4% as growth in IPTVs and broadband more than offset the decline in legacy voice service. The year-over-year decrease in ILEC residential voice connections improved to 2% excluding divestitures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial revenues decrease 4%, however we're seeing managed IP connections continue to increase. Wholesale revenues decreased only 3% partly due to favorable annual adjustments in the second quarter. Total Wireline service revenues held nearly even with the prior year at $175 million Wireline cash expenses increased 1% as increases in employee related expenses and IPTV programming cost outpaced the reduced cost of provisioning legacy services. As a result, Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we stated in our strategy, we plan for capital intensity to decline this year, as we complete our fiber build out. In the quarter capital spending declined $4 million which resulted in a higher free cash flow compared to prior year. Slide 17 shows Cable connections grew 14,600 or 5% to 287,600. On the residential side connections increased driven by 12% increase in broadband and an 18% growth in voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The residential broadband connection growth drove at 300 basis point increase in broadband penetration. And total commercial connections declined due to drop off in video, however broadband grew 11%. Staying with Cable operating performance for a minute on Slide 18. Residential revenues increased 3%, as increases from our connections growth was offset by continued promotional offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial revenues decreased 3% primarily due to a discrete adjustment that occurred last year, without this adjustment commercial revenues were up 5%. Total Cable revenues of $45 million reflected increase of 2% as reported. However without the impact of that adjustment revenues grew 5%. Cash expenses increased 7% due to the higher employee video programming cost and property taxes. As a result Cable adjusted EBITDA decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning to the HMS segment and speaking to both Pages 19 and 20 in total. You can see HMS revenues grew 6% in the quarter, this was driven by service revenue growth of 11% from increased professional services and equipment maintenance revenue. This growth offset a 2% decline in recurring hosting revenues in the quarter. Equipment sales were up 3% year-over-year due to higher spending by existing customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cash expenses were up 2% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the commissions on the higher sales. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million to $7 million. Turning to Slide 21, we have provided our 2016 guidance which is unchanged from the guidance we shared with you in February, as we anticipate the second half of the year to be in line with our initial expectations and given the timing of the FCC USF reform order. We do not expect a significant impact to this year's results. But we will revisit this again in the third quarter as we learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall we're pleased with our results of the second quarter and we'll continue to update you on our successful execution of our strategic priorities throughout the year. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jane.\n",

    "[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ric Prentiss\n",
    "\n",
    "Couple questions if I could, first, Ken you talked a lot about upgrade rates and how you look at it now because you definitely had a different trend in the industry, the industry was light on upgrades, you guys were little higher. But you also saw increasing gross adds which was something we hadn't really seen a lot. Can you wrap that around how you're looking at upgrades versus gross adds and then weave into churn also, I appreciate the postpaid phone churn number which is good. But is there further to drop on that given what you're trying to do with upgrades and gross adds kind of wrap that all into one question you can expound on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, Jay Ellison sitting here and every quarter we have this conversation about churn and you ask for lower and he squirms a little bit in his seat. But you're all connected, Ric and you got it right. It is, continuing to drive the satisfaction within our current base and as we continue to serve them well, make sure the network is where they needed, when they needed. We get to sell more services to that, so that drives our tablets, it drives other revenue line and with that comes lower churn both because a; first you're meeting our needs and then they're voting with their wallet to buy other services with you. As they do that, that also then unlocks word of mouth and it helps to fund the gross add side. We don't emphasize renewals versus growth ads, what one versus the other. We're looking to drive both of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ric Prentiss\n",
    "\n",
    "And as far as churn, do you feel there is further improvement? On a couple of calls, for last couple of quarters you've been pretty optimistic on where you could drive churn to, obviously good number but is there more to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jay Ellison\n",
    "\n",
    "Ric, this is Jay. Since Ken is staring at me, I think I'll take that part of the question. I think we have done a superb job as the business is stabilised and we really put a lot of focus and earlier mentioned as we shifted to getting contract from place with around 81% of our base [ph] under some type of lock currently and on top of that, what we are doing now is obviously further refining those programs, we offer in the marketplace whether it's in the call centers or at the point of the sale to really target those customers and further reduce that churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel confident with the level of customer engagement that we are starting to see that we will continue to see improvement in that area and that is all that I think I will say at this point and Ken continues to stare at me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "I've got it you doing it for me, Ric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jay Ellison\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ric Prentiss\n",
    "\n",
    "Great and then actually whether to switch back to Vicki for a second on the FCC. The A-CAM order if you do elect that based on the FCC details you were given, the $82.3 million revenue per year for 10 years does that start in year one, as a consistent $82 million a year and is there some kind of thought we should lay out there as far as early thinking, as far as what the capital cost per home might be to deploy that type network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, thank you Ric. First off, let me just start by saying that. I'm very pleased with the FCC's offer to provide that support necessary to bring better and faster broadband services to a substantial portion of our customers, who live in rural locations. And quite frankly that is too costly for us to build a necessary network to without this level of support from the government. The offer of $82.3 million per year over the 10 years of support is a bit higher in the earlier years and that is to support. We've got a support transition mechanism that we'll aim to be higher in the early years and then it will taper off. So in total, I think the 10-year amount is the $852 million with that transition number and yes it's going to require us to deploy significant capital over that, over that timeframe. Right now we're deep into the network build designs to try to better understand those economics before accepting the model support versus staying on rate of return. And our acceptance will be on a state-by-state level and I think it's important to remember that all rate of return carriers going forward are going to have broadband build out obligations regardless of the USF option. So right now, we're making those estimates and we'll know more as we look at 2017. As I said I don't think this will impact 2016 too significantly, we'll revisit that back in the third quarter but we have a lot of work to do before we put anything else there in terms of the capital number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ric Prentiss\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, that does based on your tone of being very pleased it does feel like you're going to be able to build something in order nice return and get people to service what they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we're pleased with the offer.\n",

    "Our next question comes from the line of Sergey Dluzhevskiy of Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question, Sergey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sergey Dluzhevskiy\n",
    "\n",
    "Couple questions, if I could. First one for Ken. You guys obviously have 4,000 towers that you own, have you look out into next two years as you're going to be deploying royalty and eventually possibly transfer for 5G. Can you talk about your strategy for utilizing those towers and how you could maximize the value and contribution from your core tower portfolio?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks, Sergey. Yes those towers are critically important to us, it allows us control over our network deployment plans and given our whole strategic positioning around quality it ensures that we have access, where we needed but it turns out it's almost two-thirds of our towers now. Also it protects us from some of the rent increases we've been hearing about in the industry and other kind of economic battle, so I'm very happy that we've got those towers. We will continue to work on growing revenues off those towers by leasing those to other parties, but they are in a fundamental underpinning to our whole networking position and I'm real glad that we've got.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sergey Dluzhevskiy\n",
    "\n",
    "Great. And I have two questions for Vicki. On A-CAM so obviously you're pleased with award $82 million I think last year in total. You guys were all federal USF you received about $74 million, $75 million could you remind us what is the comparable number for this $82 million. What portion of $74 million, compares to the $82 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, so the comparable number I think you're citing a total federal support number. The comparable number is more on the average about $50 million annually and that's coming from two, it's really replacing two funding mechanisms and our carrier loop support, their high cost loop support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sergey Dluzhevskiy\n",
    "\n",
    "Right, great and the second question on Cable acquisitions and kind of what your view is of current deal environment in the Cable space and your potential deal pipeline and if, I mean have you see some properties that maybe you came close to, I mean close to came close to passing your M&A criteria but the end of the day you decided not to pull the trigger and what were the main reasons you decided for say not to purchase them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "Well okay so, let me just say right now from an opportunity standpoint. We are seeing more activities and we saw the last half of last year. I mean it was very quiet in the last half of last year. So we're seeing more activity not particularly robust but I would say we're seeing a few more opportunities and as you know, I can't comment on and even specific in the pipeline right now. But again I wanted to reiterate we are actively pursuing Cable acquisitions and are very bullish on our Cable strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sergey Dluzhevskiy\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "A few if I can. First, Ken. Inbound roaming was up nicely year-over-year for the first time in a long time. What's the dynamic happening with potential partners?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "So I think the number is, you're obviously wrong there. Actually the roaming revenue is down year-over-year. I think Slide 8 would show that, traffic continues to grow its pricing. As pricing that also close right through to our cost line. We're going to where we need to go and want to go. It's not that we're going someplace we don't want to go. Dynamic around roaming is really getting playing us just the way that, I hope it would like to see it. We've got, now three agreements that we've executed. We're going to should we turn it out and couple more as I mentioned, our engineers have been leaving the pack and getting some technology implement that actually allows us to deliver to our customers when they're roaming data on one network, voice on a different one and what that does is that it lets us, continually monitor the customer experience to make sure that we get the best experience for our customers, wherever they're at. On the other side what that also means is that, in the past all of our roaming only been from CDMA based carriers and we thought eventually when we got to VoLTE we'd be able to serve more carriers, this would allow us to at least meet the data needs to other carriers before we get all the way to VoLTE.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's got some real positives behind it. Anything that's going on with roaming, is as our customers now get a better 4G experience as they travel. We're seeing an increase in usage from them just like we saw increase of usage when they got 4G in our own network. So couple dynamics on there, but I'm happy with where roaming is setting up in terms of the revenue picture going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so if we could ignore me being totally incorrect to start, should we start looking at the stabilizing going forward? Is that fair?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know, yes it should whether it's this quarter that we get there, whether it might from a past standpoint sequentially I got one more in front of us, but yes we should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, that's great. And then Ken higher churn of tablets versus phone that's great to break out. Does that - looking at that make you question a little bit more the value would you be easy, you still feel good about that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "No we're still, it's resting. We look at this, we look at it regularly there still nice adjunct products along a couple of different dimensions. So yes they're generating incremental revenue and incremental margins and as I said, we looked it as recently as probably last month. But in addition to that, it really goes a long way to strengthening that customer relationship and so even though you may see a higher churn rate and tablet, albeit a low rate by historic standards. It's higher than smartphones is an example. But it strengthens the overall relationship of the account. And so I'm not going to really worry about that and even at 1.8% besides the economics happen [ph] it continues to improve. It's - pretty nicely year-over-year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, you also Ken bought back some stock at U.S. Cellular in the second quarter with the LA distribution coming back on, should we look for buybacks to ramp in the third quarter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ken Meyers\n",
    "\n",
    "The LA distribution wasn't you know a reason to buy or not buy the U.S. Cellular. At the U.S. Cellular level our buyback is primarily to design just to offset the dilution that comes every year out of our different benefit plans. So that change in LA status, which we kind of anticipating isn't a big driver one way or another with our level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay and last one, if I can for Vicki. HMS equipment sales I saw nice pick up this quarter. Is that seasonal or should we be thinking that business is starting to catch some traction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "So yes, we had nice service revenue growth in the second quarter 11%, but that growth was really driven and generated by primarily professional services and selling equipment maintenance agreements on hardware purchases, so that's more one-time type revenues. These are important to our customer and our business, but we really want to see more revenue growth coming from our cloud and hosting areas, which is the recurring service revenue that really leverages our data centers and our managed service offerings. So that with strong professional services and maintenance agreements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil Cusick\n",
    "\n",
    "And what should we be thinking in terms of ramp in that cloud and hosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicki Villacrez\n",
    "\n",
    "So the ramp and the cloud and hosting, I think year-to-date has been, I think you could translate it and to the low-to-mid single digit growth for the year.\n",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Jane McCahon, Senior Vice President, Corporate Relations at TDS. Thank you, Ms. McCahon, please begin.\\nJane McCahon\\nThank you, Tim. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want to make you all aware of the presentation we have prepared to accompany our comments this morning, which you'll find on the Investor Relations sections of the TDS and U.S. Cellular websites.\\nWith me today and offering prepared comments are from U.S. Cellular, Ken Meyers, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and from TDS Telecom, Vicki Villacrez, Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.\\nThis call is being simultaneously webcast on the TDS and U.S. Cellular Investor Relations websites. Please see the websites for slides referred to on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. As a reminder, we provide guidance for both operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. For TDS Telecom, these are basically the same number. For U.S. Cellular, however, the adjusted EBITDA measure includes imputed interest income from EIP and significant contributions from our partnership, which we want to continue to highlight for investors.\\nThe information set forth in the presentation and discussed during this call contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Please review the Safe Harbor paragraph in our press releases and the extended version in our SEC filings.\\nAs mentioned on our previous calls, U.S. Cellular filed a short form application for the upcoming forward [ph] auction for 600 megahertz spectrum known as Auction 1002. As the anti-collusion rules are now in effect, we are prohibited from speaking about it further, therefore we will not entertaining any other questions relating to spectrum of the auction.\\nShortly after we released our earnings and before the call, TDS and U.S. Cellular filed their SEC forms 8-K, including today's press releases and their Form 10-Qs. Of note, in our 10-Qs we are now breaking out postpaid churn between handset and connected devices. TDS will be presenting at the Drexel Hamilton Conference in New York on September 7 and we're hosting analysts meetings at CTIA, in Las Vegas on September 8.\\nAnd please keep in mind that we do have an open door policy. So if you're ever in the Chicago area and would like to meet with members of management, the IR team will try to accommodate you, calendar's permitting.\\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Meyers.\\nKen Meyers\\nGood morning. I'll start with Slide 4. We're now halfway through the year and continuing to move forward. Our result reflects steady progress across multiple fronts. Smartphones and connected devices are growing, customer engagement continues to improve, the current network is performing well and our first voice over LTE build out is on track.\\nNow let's go little deeper starting with customer growth, our top priority. We are moving forward but still not at the pace I'd like to see. That's probably not surprising given the low churn rates we've seen across the industry and overall consumer weakness. We are having continued success with connected devices primarily tablets. Both gross and net additions are increasing and postpaid connections per account. A share of wallet metric was up 6%.\\nNet postpaid additions were more than twice than at last year at 36,000 once again driven by tablets and smartphones offset by the loss of feature phones. We continue to see good progress from our increased focus on small and medium-sized businesses in regional government entities. Handset growth adds for this segment continued to grow and our M10 [ph] sales are gaining momentum.\\nAs an organization, we're constantly measuring our customer satisfaction and adjusting our business practices and offerings to better meet their needs. Our survey showed this strategy is working is evidenced by our improving engagement scores in churn. I'm particularly encouraged by our continued improvement in postpaid churn 1.2% in the quarter, a record low for the company.\\nAs Jane mentioned in response to investor and analyst request, we've also begun to breakout postpaid handset and connected device churn, which at 1.10% and 1.84% also showed significant improvement from year ago. Our customers overall satisfaction is largely influenced by our network strategy. Last year, we completed our deployment of 4G LTE. It now reached 99% of our postpaid connections and today it's carrying almost 90% of all of our data traffic.\\nAdditionally, three 4G roaming agreements are in place, so our customers are now receiving better data experiences as they travel. Finally, so I said our network team is on track to launch our first commercial deployment of Voice over LTE early next year. I think it's important to note, the inflection point we've reached with our roaming agreements. This year, is one of significant transition as we move from 3G CDMA agreements to 4G LTE agreements to significantly lower the price per gigabit, both from revenue and expense point of view.\\nAlso our remarkably talented engineering group has lead the way in implementing technology that allows for data roaming and one network, with a fallback to another carrier for voice services. This will open up the door first provide data roaming to more than just CDMA based carriers and allows to better manage the quality of our customers roaming experiences.\\nSpend a few moments on revenue trends, overall total revenue growth is just about where we thought it would be. Service revenues are down due to multiple forces. Some of which are accounting our income statement geography, some of which are more real. First and largest, we have the impacted EIP adoptions which have the effect of moving service revenue to the equipment line.\\nAlso we have the still early but developing trend at the customer keeping equipment longer or bringing equipment with them and finally the ongoing soft pricing environment industry. These three factors combined to more than offset the positive impacts on service revenue of smartphone adoption which was now 77% of the postpaid handset base and our growth in prepaid and connected devices.\\nWithin EIP take rate of 69% in the quarter, our EIP penetration continues to grow rapidly and now is at 37% as compared to 20% a year ago. Of note, I'd also highlight that we have steadily improved the number of connections per account resulting in a year-over-year increase in average billings per account. Steve will provide more detail on these trends in a moment. But first let me lean into or perhaps share a new or different ways to think about upgrade rates.\\nHistorically, a lot of attention has been paid to upgrade rates because in a subsidized handset business model every time a customer wanted to move or upgrade to a new handset, the carrier would lose hundreds of dollars on the transaction and the customer signed a new contract. This upgrade rate was a metric that explained part of the equipment purchased [ph] each quarter, lower the upgrade rates improve the P&L. Conversely, increase the upgrade rate and negatively impact the P&L. We saw this a few years back as we transitioned off of rewards points, as a way to build customers stickiness and move back to contracts and headquarters of upgrade rates and the teams of the obvious P&L hit.\\nNot talked about or at least not talked about as much was a positive that came with us, which was more of a carrier's customer [ph] base was under contracts. In today's EIP driven business model, we've dramatically changed the economics of equipment transaction and now I look at this metric quite differently. With the P&L impact of upgrades dramatically reduced I look at renewal rates and the percent of base under contract as indicators of customer satisfaction and with 81% of our postpaid customer base under contract with us at the end of the quarter. I'm quite comfortable with where our renewal rate was this quarter, especially in light of all the anticipation it builds every time another iconic device launch approaches.\\nSpeaking of which, we will be ready to compete aggressively during the iPhone launch. We know there are still many non-U.S. Cellular customers out there that are still unaware that we carry Apple products. So we will be looking to increase that awareness and win their business. In summary, we've been making steady progress over the first half of the year and I expect to continue to move forward on our priorities during the second half.\\nAnd now, let me turn the call over to Steve.\\nSteve Campbell\\nThank you, Ken and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments with a few additional things to say about customer results shown on Slide 5 of the presentation. As Ken already mentioned, we grew connections during the second quarter with 36,000 postpaid net additions, a solid increase from 17,000 net additions a year ago. Growth was driven by positive results in both postpaid gross additions which increased 3% year-over-year to 197,000 and postpaid churn which improved again this quarter to 1.2% compared to 1.34% a year ago.\\nSimilar to the past few quarters the growth in postpaid net additions was driven by data centric devices like smartphones and connected devices, together they accounted for 57,000 net additions. In the prepaid category, we had 14,000 net additions, an increase from a year ago driven by the success of our new Simple Connect plans sold through our company and agent stores.\\nAs shown at the bottom of this slide, postpaid handset net additions were negative 13,000 an improvement from negative 19,000 in the prior year driven by reduced churn. However, although overall handset net additions were negative smartphone net additions were positive 8,000. Further when upgrades from feature phones are included total smartphone connections increased by 46,000 during the second quarter.\\nWe're providing more information about the smartphones on the next slide. Smartphones represented 91% of total handsets sold this quarter and smartphone penetration increased to 77% of our base of postpaid handset connections up from 69% a year ago. We believe that we still have some opportunity to upgrade more of our remaining feature phone customers to smartphones and drive additional data usage revenues.\\nThe next slide shows the longer term trend in our postpaid churn rate, which at 1.2% for the second quarter is at a historically low level. Now let's talk about our financial results starting with revenues. Total operating revenues for the second quarter were $980 million about the same as last year's $976 million. The small improvement in revenues reverses the trend of the last couple quarters when revenues declined both sequentially and year-over-year.\\nHowever as we look ahead, I need to remind you that last year's third quarter had a one-time bump up in revenue due to the elimination of the reward points program and we won't have another event like that, this quarter. Service revenues were $762 million down $62 million from $824 million last year. The largest component of service revenues retail service at $680 million decreased by 8% driven by lower average revenue per user. But this decrease in our pool was partially offset by the impact of growth in our customer base.\\nI'll come back and say more about ARPU in a minute. The other item contributing to the reduction in service revenues was lower, roaming which declined by $11 million or 23% primarily due to lower rates for data usage. Keep in mind that we benefit from lower rates on our outbound roaming traffic. Total expense for outbound roaming decreased by 11% year-over-year with lower rates offsetting a significant increase in data usage.\\nEquipment sales revenue grew 44% to $218 million driven by higher equipment installment plan sales. Percentage of postpaid device sales on installment plans increased to 69% in the second quarter, compared to 44% a year ago. We do expect the installment plan take rate to continue to increase over the course of the year.\\nNow I want to say a few words about our postpaid average revenue metrics. Postpaid ARPU was $47.37 for the second quarter, down 12% year-over-year. Most of this decline is driven by the continued migration to unsubsidized equipment pricing. Other factors include overall industry price competition and the growth in connected devices, which have lower average revenue.\\nSince the ARPU metric excludes equipment installment plan billings to customers another metric which includes those billings average billings per user may provide a better representation of the total amount of revenue being collected from customers every month. Reported this way, the average revenue shows a decrease of 3% year-over-year with about half of that decrease estimated to be, the dilution from connected devices.\\nThe average revenue per account benefits from the increase in connection per account which grew by 6%. For the second quarter, the average revenue per account was $124.91 down 7% year-over-year, but when equipment installment plan billings are included the average billings per account actually increased by 2% year-over-year. We expect that there will be continuing downward pressure on service revenues, but the equipment sales revenues will continue to grow as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized equipment pricing.\\nOperating cash flow for the quarter, shown next was in line with our expectations. Operating cash flow was $168 million compared to $162 million a year ago. Total cash expenses were essentially flat year-over-year with an increase in the cost of equipment driven by 6% higher volume offset by reductions in other cost categories. When looking at operating cash flow and the year-over-year comparison remember that this year's number includes the cost of the incremental customer growth that, we achieved. Retail gross additions increased by 5% and net additions increased from 25,000 to 50,000.\\nAdjusted EBITDA shown on the next slide incorporates the earnings from our equity method partnerships along with interest in dividend income which consist mainly of imputed interest income from our equipment installment plants. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $218 million compared to $207 million a year ago.\\nEarnings from unconsolidated entities were $37 million and this includes $20 million from the Los Angeles partnership, a slight increase from the year ago. Next I want to cover our annual guidance for 2016 which is shown on Slide 12 of the presentation. For comparison, we're showing our 2015 results both as reported and excluding the impact of the termination of the rewards programs.\\nOur current estimates for the year are unchanged from those provided initially in February and confirmed in May, I'll quickly review them. For total operating revenues, we expect range of approximately $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This reflects our continuing expectation for modest customer growth additional demand for data and increased adoption of equipment installment plans along with very competitive pricing environment.\\nThere is clearly uncertainty related of the impact of the new iPhone launch this fall, along with the normal uncertainty related to the holiday selling season. For operating cash flow we expect the range of $525 million to $650 million, that estimate also flows through to the estimated range for adjusted EBITDA which is $725 million to $850 million. To the extent that we achieve a lower level of customer growth and currently estimated, we would expect results to be in the upper portion of the ranges. On the other hand to the extent that we're successful in attracting higher level of customer growth than currently estimated or if the pricing environment worsens. We would expect results to be in the lower portion than the ranges.\\nCapital expenditures are expected to be about $500 million. This lower level of spending compared to 2015 reflects the completion of our 4G LTE deployment. It includes spending to meet higher data demand and to prepare for the initial commercial launch of Voice over LTE. I want to make just a couple of comments about U.S. Cellular's cash flows and liquidity. Cash flows from operating activities for the first six months of 2016 were $261 million while cash flows used for investing and financing activities totaled $355 million resulting in a net decrease in cash and equivalents with $94 million.\\nAs of June 30, cash and equivalents totaled $621 million, in addition to these existing balances U.S. Cellular has $283 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. We believe that these resources are sufficient to meet our operating investment and debt service requirements for the remainder of this year. Recall that the company has a 5.5% interest in the Los Angeles partnership and that the partnership had suspended cash distributions to the partners beginning in 2015 in connection with the purchase of spectrum license in FCC Auction 97.\\nWe were notified recently by the general partner, the note payable related to the license purchase will be completely repaid by June 30 and that cash distribution will be made in the third quarter of 2016. U.S. Cellular received a distribution of $9.6 million on July 28.\\nSo to wrap up the discussion of U.S. Cellular, I'll just reiterate what Ken said earlier. Overall, we've made steady progress over the first half of the year which results in line with our expectations and we're confident that we can continue to move forward on our priorities.\\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Vicki Villacrez to discuss TDS Telecom. Vicki?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nOkay, thank you Steve and good morning, everyone. TDS Telecom's overall results for the second quarter showed improvement over the first quarter as revenues strengthened in all three segments. First, Wireline revenues were nearly even with last year and it's adjusted for divestiture showed positive growth with a 5% increase in residential revenues. Second, Cable revenues grew 2% over the last year reflecting another quarter of strong broad brand subscriber growth of 12%. And third, HMS revenues grew 6% due to strong service revenue growth as well as increased equipment sales.\\nAs we continue to seek growth cash expenses increased in line with those revenues. As a result, adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis remains relatively flat at $80 million for the quarter. Our financial results are reflecting the successful execution of our strategy, as revenues for new products and services are offsetting declines in our legacy voice offerings.\\nWe are halfway through the year and we are tracking against our expectations. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on those strategic priorities that we shared with you on February which will be highlighted in the coming slides. Beginning with Wireline on Slide 15, our investments and our network and efforts to make higher speed options available to customer continued to drag growth in IPTV connections.\\nWe completed our planned IPTV market roll out last quarter, but continued to build out service in those 28 markets now enabling 180,000 service addresses. We are completing our planned fiber builds which will reach approximately 21% of our ILEC service addresses. And when combined with copper service, our IPTV enabled markets will cover approximately 25% of our total ILEC service addresses. For the reminder of the year, we will focus on further driving IPTV and high-speed broadband bundles in these markets.\\nTo further strengthen our broadband offerings, we are deploying bonding technology up to an additional 30% of our ILEC service addresses, in order to drive higher data speeds in our middle-tier ILEC copper markets. In our remaining markets, we are evaluating the FCC's modified universal service funding mechanism to support broadband build out.\\nRecall, that the FCC announced, a modified USF mechanism that is providing greater return carriers with two paths to receive support funds, to extend broadband services to un-served and underserved areas. TDS will need to make a decision on which support action it will elect, an alternative to connect to American Cost Models, which is commonly known as A-CAM or revised USS mechanism to say on greater returns.\\nIn order for us to make this termination, the FCC needed to finalize the amount of support that TDS would get if we elected the A-CAM path. We've just received the offer from the FCC which was made public this week. We are very pleased with the offer for $82.3 million of support revenue annual for 10 years. As it helps us provides a better, faster, broadband service to our most rural customers.\\nAdditionally will be provided funding for transition in the early years in certain states. This support comes with an obligation to build defined broadband speed to reach approximately 159,600 homes which will require a significant capital investment over a 10-year period. We have 90 days to make our decision to accept the FCC offer at which times the FCC may under certain circumstances revise their offer and we would have another 30 days to respond. The FCC's goal is to make this program effective January 1, 2017.\\nLooking at the metrics on the bottom of the slide. IPTV connections grew nearly 50% adding 13,300 compared to the prior year and we added 2,800 broadband connections excluding divestures. We are offering a variety of speeds up to 1 Gig service in all our IPTV markets. The uptick in IPTV has grown steadily and is now in an average penetration rate of almost 30% of residential service addresses. It is important to remember that 97% of our IPTV customers, subscribe to a triple play bundle which results in a low churn rate and continues to increase average revenues per connection, which is now up 4% to $43.67 in the quarter.\\nReflecting both our fiber and bonded copper deployments, residential broadband customers in these ILEC markets are continuing to choose higher speeds with 50% choosing speed of 10 megabits or greater and 19% choosing speeds of 25 megabits or greater. This will also contribute to the higher ARPUs we've been experiencing.\\nLooking at Slide 16, Wireline results were solid even with 2015 ILEC divestitures which reduced revenues and expenses about 1%. As reported residential revenues increased 4% as growth in IPTVs and broadband more than offset the decline in legacy voice service. The year-over-year decrease in ILEC residential voice connections improved to 2% excluding divestitures.\\nCommercial revenues decrease 4%, however we're seeing managed IP connections continue to increase. Wholesale revenues decreased only 3% partly due to favorable annual adjustments in the second quarter. Total Wireline service revenues held nearly even with the prior year at $175 million Wireline cash expenses increased 1% as increases in employee related expenses and IPTV programming cost outpaced the reduced cost of provisioning legacy services. As a result, Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 2%.\\nAs we stated in our strategy, we plan for capital intensity to decline this year, as we complete our fiber build out. In the quarter capital spending declined $4 million which resulted in a higher free cash flow compared to prior year. Slide 17 shows Cable connections grew 14,600 or 5% to 287,600. On the residential side connections increased driven by 12% increase in broadband and an 18% growth in voice.\\nThe residential broadband connection growth drove at 300 basis point increase in broadband penetration. And total commercial connections declined due to drop off in video, however broadband grew 11%. Staying with Cable operating performance for a minute on Slide 18. Residential revenues increased 3%, as increases from our connections growth was offset by continued promotional offerings.\\nCommercial revenues decreased 3% primarily due to a discrete adjustment that occurred last year, without this adjustment commercial revenues were up 5%. Total Cable revenues of $45 million reflected increase of 2% as reported. However without the impact of that adjustment revenues grew 5%. Cash expenses increased 7% due to the higher employee video programming cost and property taxes. As a result Cable adjusted EBITDA decreased.\\nTurning to the HMS segment and speaking to both Pages 19 and 20 in total. You can see HMS revenues grew 6% in the quarter, this was driven by service revenue growth of 11% from increased professional services and equipment maintenance revenue. This growth offset a 2% decline in recurring hosting revenues in the quarter. Equipment sales were up 3% year-over-year due to higher spending by existing customers.\\nCash expenses were up 2% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the commissions on the higher sales. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million to $7 million. Turning to Slide 21, we have provided our 2016 guidance which is unchanged from the guidance we shared with you in February, as we anticipate the second half of the year to be in line with our initial expectations and given the timing of the FCC USF reform order. We do not expect a significant impact to this year's results. But we will revisit this again in the third quarter as we learn more.\\nOverall we're pleased with our results of the second quarter and we'll continue to update you on our successful execution of our strategic priorities throughout the year. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jane.\\nJane McCahon\\nThanks, Vicki and Tim, we're ready for questions.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\\nRic Prentiss\\nCouple questions if I could, first, Ken you talked a lot about upgrade rates and how you look at it now because you definitely had a different trend in the industry, the industry was light on upgrades, you guys were little higher. But you also saw increasing gross adds which was something we hadn't really seen a lot. Can you wrap that around how you're looking at upgrades versus gross adds and then weave into churn also, I appreciate the postpaid phone churn number which is good. But is there further to drop on that given what you're trying to do with upgrades and gross adds kind of wrap that all into one question you can expound on.\\nKen Meyers\\nWell, Jay Ellison sitting here and every quarter we have this conversation about churn and you ask for lower and he squirms a little bit in his seat. But you're all connected, Ric and you got it right. It is, continuing to drive the satisfaction within our current base and as we continue to serve them well, make sure the network is where they needed, when they needed. We get to sell more services to that, so that drives our tablets, it drives other revenue line and with that comes lower churn both because a; first you're meeting our needs and then they're voting with their wallet to buy other services with you. As they do that, that also then unlocks word of mouth and it helps to fund the gross add side. We don't emphasize renewals versus growth ads, what one versus the other. We're looking to drive both of them.\\nRic Prentiss\\nAnd as far as churn, do you feel there is further improvement? On a couple of calls, for last couple of quarters you've been pretty optimistic on where you could drive churn to, obviously good number but is there more to go.\\nJay Ellison\\nRic, this is Jay. Since Ken is staring at me, I think I'll take that part of the question. I think we have done a superb job as the business is stabilised and we really put a lot of focus and earlier mentioned as we shifted to getting contract from place with around 81% of our base [ph] under some type of lock currently and on top of that, what we are doing now is obviously further refining those programs, we offer in the marketplace whether it's in the call centers or at the point of the sale to really target those customers and further reduce that churn.\\nI feel confident with the level of customer engagement that we are starting to see that we will continue to see improvement in that area and that is all that I think I will say at this point and Ken continues to stare at me.\\nKen Meyers\\nI've got it you doing it for me, Ric.\\nJay Ellison\\nThanks.\\nRic Prentiss\\nGreat and then actually whether to switch back to Vicki for a second on the FCC. The A-CAM order if you do elect that based on the FCC details you were given, the $82.3 million revenue per year for 10 years does that start in year one, as a consistent $82 million a year and is there some kind of thought we should lay out there as far as early thinking, as far as what the capital cost per home might be to deploy that type network.\\nVicki Villacrez\\nSure, thank you Ric. First off, let me just start by saying that. I'm very pleased with the FCC's offer to provide that support necessary to bring better and faster broadband services to a substantial portion of our customers, who live in rural locations. And quite frankly that is too costly for us to build a necessary network to without this level of support from the government. The offer of $82.3 million per year over the 10 years of support is a bit higher in the earlier years and that is to support. We've got a support transition mechanism that we'll aim to be higher in the early years and then it will taper off. So in total, I think the 10-year amount is the $852 million with that transition number and yes it's going to require us to deploy significant capital over that, over that timeframe. Right now we're deep into the network build designs to try to better understand those economics before accepting the model support versus staying on rate of return. And our acceptance will be on a state-by-state level and I think it's important to remember that all rate of return carriers going forward are going to have broadband build out obligations regardless of the USF option. So right now, we're making those estimates and we'll know more as we look at 2017. As I said I don't think this will impact 2016 too significantly, we'll revisit that back in the third quarter but we have a lot of work to do before we put anything else there in terms of the capital number.\\nRic Prentiss\\nOkay, that does based on your tone of being very pleased it does feel like you're going to be able to build something in order nice return and get people to service what they want.\\nVicki Villacrez\\nYes, we're pleased with the offer.\\nRic Prentiss\\nGreat, thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Sergey Dluzhevskiy of Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question, Sergey.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nCouple questions, if I could. First one for Ken. You guys obviously have 4,000 towers that you own, have you look out into next two years as you're going to be deploying royalty and eventually possibly transfer for 5G. Can you talk about your strategy for utilizing those towers and how you could maximize the value and contribution from your core tower portfolio?\\nKen Meyers\\nThanks, Sergey. Yes those towers are critically important to us, it allows us control over our network deployment plans and given our whole strategic positioning around quality it ensures that we have access, where we needed but it turns out it's almost two-thirds of our towers now. Also it protects us from some of the rent increases we've been hearing about in the industry and other kind of economic battle, so I'm very happy that we've got those towers. We will continue to work on growing revenues off those towers by leasing those to other parties, but they are in a fundamental underpinning to our whole networking position and I'm real glad that we've got.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nGreat. And I have two questions for Vicki. On A-CAM so obviously you're pleased with award $82 million I think last year in total. You guys were all federal USF you received about $74 million, $75 million could you remind us what is the comparable number for this $82 million. What portion of $74 million, compares to the $82 million.\\nVicki Villacrez\\nYes, so the comparable number I think you're citing a total federal support number. The comparable number is more on the average about $50 million annually and that's coming from two, it's really replacing two funding mechanisms and our carrier loop support, their high cost loop support.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nRight, great and the second question on Cable acquisitions and kind of what your view is of current deal environment in the Cable space and your potential deal pipeline and if, I mean have you see some properties that maybe you came close to, I mean close to came close to passing your M&A criteria but the end of the day you decided not to pull the trigger and what were the main reasons you decided for say not to purchase them.\\nVicki Villacrez\\nWell okay so, let me just say right now from an opportunity standpoint. We are seeing more activities and we saw the last half of last year. I mean it was very quiet in the last half of last year. So we're seeing more activity not particularly robust but I would say we're seeing a few more opportunities and as you know, I can't comment on and even specific in the pipeline right now. But again I wanted to reiterate we are actively pursuing Cable acquisitions and are very bullish on our Cable strategies.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\\nPhil Cusick\\nA few if I can. First, Ken. Inbound roaming was up nicely year-over-year for the first time in a long time. What's the dynamic happening with potential partners?\\nKen Meyers\\nSo I think the number is, you're obviously wrong there. Actually the roaming revenue is down year-over-year. I think Slide 8 would show that, traffic continues to grow its pricing. As pricing that also close right through to our cost line. We're going to where we need to go and want to go. It's not that we're going someplace we don't want to go. Dynamic around roaming is really getting playing us just the way that, I hope it would like to see it. We've got, now three agreements that we've executed. We're going to should we turn it out and couple more as I mentioned, our engineers have been leaving the pack and getting some technology implement that actually allows us to deliver to our customers when they're roaming data on one network, voice on a different one and what that does is that it lets us, continually monitor the customer experience to make sure that we get the best experience for our customers, wherever they're at. On the other side what that also means is that, in the past all of our roaming only been from CDMA based carriers and we thought eventually when we got to VoLTE we'd be able to serve more carriers, this would allow us to at least meet the data needs to other carriers before we get all the way to VoLTE.\\nSo it's got some real positives behind it. Anything that's going on with roaming, is as our customers now get a better 4G experience as they travel. We're seeing an increase in usage from them just like we saw increase of usage when they got 4G in our own network. So couple dynamics on there, but I'm happy with where roaming is setting up in terms of the revenue picture going forward.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay, so if we could ignore me being totally incorrect to start, should we start looking at the stabilizing going forward? Is that fair?\\nKen Meyers\\nI don't know, yes it should whether it's this quarter that we get there, whether it might from a past standpoint sequentially I got one more in front of us, but yes we should be.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay, that's great. And then Ken higher churn of tablets versus phone that's great to break out. Does that - looking at that make you question a little bit more the value would you be easy, you still feel good about that?\\nKen Meyers\\nNo we're still, it's resting. We look at this, we look at it regularly there still nice adjunct products along a couple of different dimensions. So yes they're generating incremental revenue and incremental margins and as I said, we looked it as recently as probably last month. But in addition to that, it really goes a long way to strengthening that customer relationship and so even though you may see a higher churn rate and tablet, albeit a low rate by historic standards. It's higher than smartphones is an example. But it strengthens the overall relationship of the account. And so I'm not going to really worry about that and even at 1.8% besides the economics happen [ph] it continues to improve. It's - pretty nicely year-over-year.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay, you also Ken bought back some stock at U.S. Cellular in the second quarter with the LA distribution coming back on, should we look for buybacks to ramp in the third quarter?\\nKen Meyers\\nThe LA distribution wasn't you know a reason to buy or not buy the U.S. Cellular. At the U.S. Cellular level our buyback is primarily to design just to offset the dilution that comes every year out of our different benefit plans. So that change in LA status, which we kind of anticipating isn't a big driver one way or another with our level.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay and last one, if I can for Vicki. HMS equipment sales I saw nice pick up this quarter. Is that seasonal or should we be thinking that business is starting to catch some traction?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nSo yes, we had nice service revenue growth in the second quarter 11%, but that growth was really driven and generated by primarily professional services and selling equipment maintenance agreements on hardware purchases, so that's more one-time type revenues. These are important to our customer and our business, but we really want to see more revenue growth coming from our cloud and hosting areas, which is the recurring service revenue that really leverages our data centers and our managed service offerings. So that with strong professional services and maintenance agreements.\\nPhil Cusick\\nAnd what should we be thinking in terms of ramp in that cloud and hosting?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nSo the ramp and the cloud and hosting, I think year-to-date has been, I think you could translate it and to the low-to-mid single digit growth for the year.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay, thanks Vicki.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] If there are no further questions, I'll like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\\nJane McCahon\\nWe'd like to thank you all for your participation on summer Friday. So if you have any other follow-up questions let us know or we'll look forward to seeing you over the next few months. Thanks so much.\",\n",

    "Good morning. My name is Lori, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weatherford International Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, today's call is being recorded. Thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would now like to turn the conference over to Karen David-Green, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Ms. David-Green, you may begin your conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Karen David-Green\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, Lori and good morning everyone. With me on today's call from Houston we have Bernard Duroc-Danner, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Krishna Shivram, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start our comments, I'd like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our third quarter press release for the customary caution on forward-looking statements and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\n",

    "And now I'd like to hand over the call to Krishna.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you Karen and good morning everyone. Today I am going to focus most of my comments on the cash flow and the balance sheet including debt and debt covenants. I will start with a brief recap of our operating performance in the third quarter. Sequential incrementals were 2% and the year-over-year decrementals were 29% which are not only excellent but also leagues ahead of the decrementals registered in 2009.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a full nine months basis, the year-to-date decrementals were a best in class 28% and easily beat our larger peers whose decrementals range between 31% and 40%. These low decrementals are a testament to the effectiveness of the cost management efforts made by the company this year in response to the down cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss per share for the quarter before charges and credits was $0.05. The revenue of $2.24 billion for the quarter decreased 6% sequentially and 42% year-on-year. Operating income margins before R&D and corporate expenses improved by 47 basis points sequentially to 5.4%. On an overall basis sequential improvements in our North American operations and our international land drilling rigs business more than offset a decline in our international performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below operating margins both are R&D and corporate cost show sequential declines reflecting cost reductions steps that were taken. Going forward both R&D and corporate cost will continue to trend down from third quarter levels. Foreign exchange losses consumed $0.02 of EPS, and asset write offs in sub Sahara, Africa of $0.01 completely offset a gain of $0.03 on repurchasing long dated bonds that were quoting well below par during the third quarter. In addition this repurchase will reduce annual interest cost by $15 million in 2016 and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tax benefit recorded in third quarter reflected the tax benefit on the losses in the U.S. primarily which are recoverable partly offset by tax provisions internationally where we continue to be profitable. The weighted average tax rate for the year will be in the low to mid 30s and will be a net tax benefit. In summary, our continuing cost management efforts and improved North American operating results coupled with the relative resilience offered international margins and a boost from our rigs businesses allowed us to improve sequential operating income on 153 million lower revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving onto net debt and cash flow now. Net debt reduced by $28 million to reach 7.19 billion at the end of the third quarter reflecting positive free cash flow from operations of $123 million. The third quarter is normally a challenging quarter for free cash flow as it has a higher cash interest payment to bond holders by about 100 million compared to the second quarter. This year it has been even more challenging than other years because in addition to the extra cash interest burden we have $33 million of net cash consumption on the Zubair contract and $46 million of cash severance payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these headwinds our focus on actively managing our working capital, CAPEX, and our cost base has resulted in the reduction of working capital by $170 million and CAPEX dropped by $56 million from the second quarter to reach $131 million for the third quarter. This was the first time we have generated positive free cash flow in the third quarter of a year since the third quarter of 2010 in spite of much more challenging business conditions. During the quarter we paid $120 million as a onetime settlement of the Freedman case which is the last class action law suit related to our financial restatements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition we opportunistically repurchased $236 million of book value of our long-term debt generating a onetime pretax gain of $35 million while also reducing our future annual interest cost by 15 million. This action demonstrates our confidence in generating enough free cash flow from operations consistently allowing us to not only manage business needs but also manage maturing debt in 2016 and 2017, which we expect to repay with free cash flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, working capital will continue to generate positive free cash flow through till the end of the year while we expect positive cash flows from the Zubair contract based on milestone dates we are currently targeting, our capital expenditure plan for the year has now been revised down by another $100 million to $650 million which is 55% lower than 2014 levels. Our fourth quarter free cash flow target is between $200 million and $300 million which will make us free cash flow positive for the entire year for the first time since 2010. Coupled with first quarter 2016, free cash flow which we also expect will be positive. This will fully finance the maturing bond of 350 million in February of next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of September 30th, available liquidity was $1.7 billion, meaning we have a large borrowing cushion still available to us. I would like to clarify a few matters around our covenants. Firstly we have no financial or leverage covenants. I repeat, we have no financial or leverage covenants at all on our public bonds. There are also no rating, no credit agency rating triggers either.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only covenant we have is on our revolving credit facility and this is set at a 60% debt to total cap ratio. The definition of the covenant is as follows, in the numerator the number used for debt includes total debt, including adjustments for derivative positions. As of September 30th this number is $7.72 billion which is 14 million higher than a 10-Q reported balance sheet debt number. In the denominator we add the same total debt number to the equity number to get the total capitalization number. The equity number is defined in the covenant definition as including minority or non-controlling interest and allows an add back for foreign currency translation adjustments on non-monetary assets held around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the extraordinary strength of the U.S. dollar this year versus most global currencies, the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment as of September 30th is $1.4 billion. Adding this adjustment to the 10-Q reported net equity of $5.75 billion, the adjusted equity for covenant purposes is 7.16 billion resulting in a total capitalization number of 14.88 billion. The debt to cap ratio thus calculated as of September 30th is $7.72 billion of debt divided by $14.88 billion of total capitalization which is 51.9%. This compares to 51.8% as of June 30th, meaning the ratio has hardly moved in Q3. This also means there is plenty of headroom on the covenant and we believe there is absolutely no danger of breaching it particularly in the projected scenario of continuous free cash flow generation and pay down of debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would now like to offer a view on next year's cash flow. Our ability to generate positive free cash flow next year is dependent on three key variables. The first is the net cash flow from the Zubair EPF contract in Iraq. Based on the milestones dates we currently forecast which would trigger contractual payments further augmented by potential settlements of extra contractual claims we have made on our customer for change orders. We expect 2016 to be a net cash flow positive year for this contract with a year-over-year $200 million cash inflows versus 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second key variable is cash severance and restructuring cost. In 2015 we will end up spending about $170 million in cash severance cost by year-end. In 2016, our current view is that this would not exceed more than $20 million meaning that year-on-year we would have an improvement of at least $150 million on this account. The third key variable is capital expenditure. Based on the quantity of excess equipment we have in all product lines, we do not envisage any growth CAPEX for 2016 even if activity levels increase. We will incur maintenance CAPEX of course. This will be in the order of $400 million which is $250 million lower than in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add the impact of these three variables together, the incremental cash flow in 2016 versus 2015 is $600 million. We are confident that variations in earnings and working capital should nullify each other. Given a range of 150 million to 250 million of free cash flow this year, adding the 600 million on these three key variables will provide more than enough cash to repay both the February 2016 maturity of 350 million and the June 2017 debt maturity of $600 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also adopted much better controls on our external spend in terms of expenditure and CAPEX purchase orders. There is sharing of equipment, inventory, and other materials right across the company. Product lines and businesses have asset utilization goals and cash flow related targets. And all of these measures have helped in reducing cost, increasing discipline, and improving cash flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a leaner and more focused organization setting us up for strong incrementals in earnings and cash flow when activity levels increased overtime. This can be achieved quite simply by constraining three variables as we grow. Firstly, we will constrain CAPEX until we mop up all the excess equipment we have and fully utilize the extensive infrastructure we have built globally over the years. We believe we can subsist on a maintenance CAPEX diet for the next three years notwithstanding activity growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly we will constrain support costs until the support ratio gets to the 30% to 35% range. We believe this can be achieved both by reducing further our support structure as well as adding more direct headcount when activity returns. And lastly controlling external spending particularly discretionary spending is very well managed now.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we believe that we have managed the down cycle well with best in class year-to-date decrementals of 28% that are better than all of our larger peers and materially lower than the 140% decrementals experienced during the last down cycle. This would not have happened in the past. Weatherford is truly a different company today. With that I will now turn the call over to Bernard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you Krishna and good morning everyone. Q3 earnings per share is loss of $0.05. Taxes reflect the fact that operating losses were in the U.S. which are efficiency tax affected. We took $0.02 of foreign exchange losses and $0.03 on bond repurchases and we took about $0.01 write off in SSA. As a synthesis operations delivered results consistent with the $0.05 loss. It is difficult to describe a quarter in which we remain unprofitable but successful. But it was, we are making operational progress and this isn't a random event. We see similar sort of operational performance in Q4 and thereon.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll focus my comments today on three issues; the operating underpinnings of the Q3 results, forward use for Q4, and our direction. First, operational underpinnings of Q3, North American NAM reported significantly stronger numbers in Q2. There were three factors behind the performance; cost, share gains, and Canada. Cost cuts, we were early and we were in deep and we did not pause in our efforts. We are just transforming the U.S. cost structure. It goes beyond aggressively cutting direct cost with declining volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also address equally aggressively the support structure. We de-lever the organization, rationalize facilities infrastructure, upgraded the talent bench both internally and through outside hires. It is still work in process but through year-to-date a considerable change in operating economics has been achieved. The quarter’s results in the midst of a miserable market was a clear demonstration of what could be achieved with a relentless operating focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "NAM is ahead of our head of our international operations efficiency. The international segments will catch on very quickly with NAM. Measurable share gains in our core product lines, we had the most gain, bring services, completion, and artificial lift. The particular base seems to be credited depending on the product line it was widespread from California to the Marseilles including Europe and Utica and the Permian.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time we purposely scaled back operations and therefore share for two product lines, grading tools otherwise known as rentals and pressure pumping. In both cases there are essentially no barriers to entry, vast supply of equipment, and increasing punitive economics. We won't pursue contracts that have punitive returns. We don’t have to and we won't. We would rather let others do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third factor, seasonal improvement in Canada. Canada helped but it wasn’t the factor it normally is. The seasonal recovery was somewhere between anemic and non-existent. What moved Q3 isn't Canada or it’s not Canada alone by far. We are doing fundamental efficiency work in the U.S. addressing the structural as well as the cyclical and the talent bench. The U.S. will be transformed operational and we’re finished. But expect this trend to continue in Q4.\n",
    "\n",
    "International was down sequentially both revenues and margins. The cause and effect was different depending on the particular regions. We experienced volume declines in Asia, SSA, and Latin America. SSA was made worse by an asset write off. Latin Americas decline occurred in Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, and Columbia in that order of descending magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also had product and service delivery delays by client election in Europe and MENA pushing revenues into Q4. Averaging Q3 and Q4 will provide a better picture where our profitability will settle in those two large regions. MENA and Europe will be stronger in Q4 and of course we had continued strong performance in Russia and Argentina. And we are in the midst of the same operating season internationally as we are expected in NAM, we are one quarter behind in execution, we should expect the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4 outlook, the overall market will be weaker in Q4 than in Q3 in both NAM and international markets. Assessment of the near-term is not that dissimilar to what has been shared by our peers. We also agree somewhere between Q4 and Q1 will be the low where they are cyclical to pressure. In this environment our Q4 is likely to be as follows. We expect NAM results to show lower revenues by low double-digit. But we are planning for an operating income only marginally down versus Q3.\n",
    "\n",
    "International will be overall flat both at the revenue and operating income line. This is inspite of the anticipated market decline. Here again there will be regional differences. Latin America results are likely to show low revenues and commensurate declines in operating profits. We should manage decrementals in United America very patiently. This region has done so consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eastern Hemisphere results are likely to show modestly higher revenues and an increase in profitability. Adding all the pieces together that is NAM and international, Q4 is expected to show single-digit lower revenues and near flat operating income. This is for core. The rigs which are run standalone and had a respectable Q3 are likely to decline sequentially. A few of our rigs are demobilized and in transit in Q4, will start up in late Q1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company will be free cash flow positive in Q4. In fact Q4 should be our highest free cash flow quarter for 2015. We will be free cash flow positive for the full year. In prior calls we indicated and estimated $150 million to $250 million range for the year for the free cash flow for the full year of 2015. We will likely close the year on the upper end of that range. Net debt will decline to under 7 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give more detailed regional review for the international segment, MENA will play an increasingly important role as it unfolds its turnaround. The progression will come from incremental business in the two largest Gulf markets, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia which is also broadening with contractual wins in Algeria, Oman, Qatar, and Egypt. We are gradually recovering market share lost years ago. MENA will be progressively stronger in quarters ahead and we are quite sure of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Russia was severely hit by the Rouble exchange rate but from an incremental business volume standpoint our Russian regions will continue to do well driven by share gains and formation valuation and well construction. Russia's volumes are showing essentially flat quarter in Q4 inspite of the onset of the winter season. Clients are moving activity in opposite directions but the nut and bolt is the flat activity level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Europe Caspian activity will be stronger at the revenue line from Q3 levels with some improvements and profitability coming out of the UK and the Caspian. These are primarily service and product line sales originally expected in Q3. SSA, activity will continue to experience slow down and project delays. Our operations though have had some counter cyclical gains and expect progress in well construction and overall market penetration. As a result we expect revenues and profitability in Q4 not to deteriorate any further on Q3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asia has experienced much lower activity driven by large budgetary cuts in Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, and China, across the Board really. We expect activity wise it has just about bottomed out albeit at a very low level of activity. A combination of share gains and well construction and completion together with aggressive cost actions underway is mitigating the volume and pricing declines. Asia results will be about flat in Q3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latin America, we will manage a further decline in Mexico, Columbia, and Brazil. Share gains in well construction completion and rig services and the lower cost structure will manage decrementals efficiently and keep the regions profitability at a high level. Both Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America and aggressively implementing similar cost efficiency actions as the NAM together with a tight focus on sales and marketing of our core product lines. Combination of this and our improved operations in NAM makes a less spark outlook for Q4, versus our larger peers. As mentioned earlier, rigs will have low revenues operating income in Q4 both picking it back up when rigs are mobilized and new contract wins in early 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments on direction, our direction is clear to all within Weatherford. We are changing the rules of engagement in all of our business dealings. We focus on core cost and cash. We build on our operating progress to date with more efficiency, cash discipline, systematic talent upgrades, and market share focus. We changed operating economics perennially or we try to. We de-lever the balance sheet through free cash flow generation quarter-after-quarter with no exceptions. This is no direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have to clarify one point, as a matter of strategic choice we’ll not participate in any bidding for divested assets. We have abundant opportunities internally to generate high returns through efficiencies, high grading talents, and harvesting considerable stock of technology and worldwide setup infrastructure. The absence of any distraction is a taxable advantage for 2016 and 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "We made an exception for Sperry. This is a one off situation for our core. The interest in Sperry based on the high level of operating efficiencies given the service and infrastructure intensity of the business. Sperry is a hard business to run standalone for any non-strategic owner. The economics was strong but it could not overcome the cost of capital. Cost of capital matters and we are disciplined. This is now a closed issue. There will be no other bidding attempts on any other divested assets. As I said earlier on we have high returns and lower risk opportunities internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the kind of market in which we can make fast and deep cost progress as structural changes to redirect a culture and rebuild a strong bench. Our action centers around improving these things and doing so in a perennial way. Lower cost structures through cycles, capital allocation, and cash generation as a companywide discipline, Leap Frog talent bench and talent development as a culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll try to provide some color on some of the accomplishments, our work in progress. I will focus on this year's cost action understanding we started and acted earlier last year. In July we announced the increase of the reduction in force exercise 11,000 employees. In early September we increased the target to 14,000 employees or little over 25% of the workforce at the start of the year. As of October 15th, we have released 12,153 employees generating annualized cost savings of 926 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "The savings have resulted in the excellent decrementals experienced to date companywide. These savings will roll over in 2016, with more impact than this year. Our support ratio did for 41.5% -- to 41.5% for 45% sum of the year continues to target a sub 40% support ratio by year end and low to mid 30% by 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ended last year with 56,000 employees and we ended the third quarter with a headcount of 42,800 employees. Of this rigs represent about 5000 employees and our core business 37,800. We are likely to close the year with a headcount closer to 41,000 and our core at 36,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had also planned to shutdown seven of our manufacturing facilities this year, five have been closed down to date with one planned each for the next two quarters. Separately we have shutdown and consolidated 70 operating facilities across North America to date. We expect to close 20 more by year end.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re not cutting into muscle, we are adding muscle by high grading internally. And we are selectively adding new hires to specific positions to strengthen our bench. We run the company with eight regions and 12 product lines inclusive of rigs. So journey to date we have changed six out of our eight Regional Vice Presidents in which four internal high grading and two were outside hires. We have changed seven out of our 12 product line needles again in combination of three internal high grading and four outside hires.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire open organization is going through the same strengthening process. Again this has everything to do with efficiency and productivity. It will pay off. At a company like Weatherford, we never push this as far as we could go. I just have a few comments on the synthesis. The oil industry at this point unsustainably are underfunded and under invested. Pessimism is everywhere. It is neither reasonable nor realistic. If cut all pricing and related all selectivity in Europe that will deteriorate further. We do not believe the industry will be able to manage required oil supplies as early as 2017. This means oil demand will not be met by existing oil capacity. And the Toyota angle [ph] will help, that isn’t sustainable solution for long we are quite sure of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the qualifier to decline rates on destiny as a summary of why this is an intractable fact. Declining rates are in our view the most important structural factor to consider, more so where the demand growth in 2016 will be $1 million, $1.2 million, $1.5 million per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present state of industry depression has offered us great opportunities. We are positioning Weatherford with selected markets and clients using our product line strengths. We are using the brutal recession to fundamentally change our cost structure, quality, efficiency, and talent strength. This is today a very different company. Our operating and management capabilities are immeasurably stronger than they historically were.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a worldwide infrastructure and service support second to none. We are confident of our technological strengths, of our product line and breadth, and the market potential for organic growth. Our numbers ultimately will prove out the merits of our direction in this brutal down cycle and where the market ends. We believe this is what will deliver by far the highest soluble returns at the lowest risk. This direction will not change. With that I would turn the call to operator to Q&A.\n",

    "Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Jim Crandell of Cowen Securities. Your line is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "James Crandell\n",
    "\n",
    "Good morning everyone and congratulations on the strong free cash flow and the North American performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you Jim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "James Crandell\n",
    "\n",
    "First question is, it is kind of a comment Bernard and maybe you can -- you will answer it, I am just going to make a comment and then a question, both about North America. I guess my comment is that the businesses that really gained share have either been through a change of ownership recently as in the case of large initial left [ph] or companies going through a merger in the case of Halliburton and was curious as to your thoughts on how that's maybe contributing to your share gains? And then my question on North America is, if you could at least give some kind of guidance, how much of the North American losses are in frac?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let me -- I think on the first question, there isn’t an evidence of any particular share gains on any of our larger peers. We have anecdotal evidence here and there but I wouldn’t say there is a passion at all, not today. I mean most of the share gains from our product lines have to do with particular technology offerings and/or product introduction and/or ability to be very efficient. So it is not -- there isn’t a particular story there. One play or another using market share in any particular product lines, not today. This is self observation. With respect to where the losses are, I think it is fair to say that if we didn’t have especially in United States I think North America will be breakeven or profitable without a doubt. I think if you also didn’t have rental tools you would actually be actually profitable. So there you have your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "James Crandell\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow, okay. You know you gave a good rundown on the fourth quarter, if we continue in that sort of flattish oil price environment Bernard, how would you see the trends in quarter one and quarter two and operating results both in North America and international?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "It is complicated because you have seasonality of course. If you adjust the seasonality, please believe that the market low will be as I have tried to convey between Q4 and Q1. This is activity low. Now you got to adjust the seasonality. For example Russia and Asia goes down in the Q1 as you know as does follow the North Sea whereas Canada goes up however anemically in Q1. So you have seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "But our view is that from an operating income from an earnings perspective I think the company’s performance will be similar to what it has been in Q3 with two sort of adjustments to think about; one is rigs. Those numbers may go down and then back up again, that is one factor. It is not immaterial but it is not the core either but it is a number. The other numbers to watch of course is if what happens on the foreign exchange losses and if we do or don’t have gains on further volume purchases these sorts of things that will impact the earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I think from an operating income standpoint although we expect operating income to be marginally lower in NAM we don’t expect it to be any lower internationally in Q4. In fact a little bit up in Q1. I would say that probably international will be down versus our Q4 simply because of the seasonality. NAM hard to tell Q1, I don’t expect anything dramatic in Q1 because in Q1, Canada will help a bit more in Q1, U.S. a bit less because seasonality will see other way in the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing dramatic out of NAM in Q4 and Q1. International better in Q4. International possibly good seasonality a bit weaker in Q1, and from Q2 we think international actually starts to heal based on cost efficiencies and particular gates. There are some reasons that will shine. Expect MENA to shine actually in Q1. It will be sort of the standout region, etc because there are different factors at play there. Sorry for the long answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "James Crandell\n",
    "\n",
    "No, that’s fine. And a final question if I could for Krishna, what would if there is a downgrade of your debt by the rating agencies what would that mean for Weatherford?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Jim, that would really have no discernible impact on Weatherford. First of all there will be no loss of access to the rep markets in anyway because the CP market and the revolver are interchangeable and the revolver backs up the CP in any case. So there would be no loss of access.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I said before in our prepared comments we have a $1.7 billion of liquidity available at the end of September and we expect that amount of liquidity to keep growing overtime as we generate more free cash flow, so no loss of access. In terms of cost, our cost of borrowing may go up slightly and our analysis tell us that it is probably going to increase our interest cost next year by $11 million for the full year versus this year. But then again you’ll see from our buybacks or bonds in Q3, as also we did the same thing in Q1, we bought back some bonds in Q1 of this year. The savings and interest that we generated out of those buybacks are in excess of 25 million so far. So really the overall cost impact is not going to be material. If anything there is a cost benefit because of the buybacks going forward. So really no impact there.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as company business is concerned we don’t have a single instance that we know of at all where our customers demand a certain credit rating to qualify for contracts. This is not a question that's asked on any tender or any contract anywhere in the world. So really there is no major impact of any sort that we can see if a downgrade does occur. We are talking to the rating agencies regularly and we’ll see where that goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "James Crandell\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Your next question is from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ole Slorer\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you again and congrats on the performance, it was nice to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you Ole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ole Slorer\n",
    "\n",
    "So just going forward a little bit it sounds as if what you are guiding is a rebalancing of the very strong Latin American margins down a little bit and more of an even performance between those in Eastern Hemisphere, is that the way to read it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that is to say fairly. On the Eastern Hemisphere I would suggest as we average both Q3 and Q4 to get the right picture not that Q3 was very, very bad but I think Q4 maybe a little bit better than we have. Rig business move from one to the other, should we average them both to get a picture but I do think what you said is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ole Slorer\n",
    "\n",
    "And when it comes to the reduction in CAPEX next year just to get some more clarity, was that because of a reduction in investments in rentals and pressure pumping predominantly. What are the biggest deltas in terms of taking it down that much?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "No, it isn’t, we are not seeing any money pressure pumping and bear minimum in drilling tools. So that is not so much that will likely continue. No, I think Krishna will comment on it, I would just say that we have taken stock methodically of the abundance of tools and equipment we have company wide, worldwide. We also improved dramatically, the visibility because you can't move and use things unless they are very visible, measurable, and therefore movable. And we also changed the culture, so the culture of holding on to equipment, hoping for better day versus the efficient allocation resources, equipment and tools move, well that got done. We now have a pretty good picture of what we have and what we could use and for how long. And our decisions on CAPEX come from that particular analysis, Krishna might want to comment also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah, secondly I would say that we had quite an overhang of CAPEX orders coming from 2014 into 2015. If you look at our CAPEX in the first half of 2015 they really represented orders that were issued out of Weatherford at a time when the prognosis was much more rosy of the business. If you look at the orders that are outstanding today, CAPEX orders, and you just carry that forward into next year it is quite easy to see that we can reduce the CAPEX to 400 million. In fact that run rate is being achieved in Q4 this year already pretty much.\n",
    "\n",
    "And secondly yes, exactly as Bernard said we have enough CAPEX to manage at least 25% to 30% growth in physical activity from where we are now with no promise whatsoever without adding to any growth CAPEX as a company. We just need maintenance CAPEX. So, this is what I meant by saying we can subsist on a maintenance CAPEX diet for a quite a long time going into the future. It represents an overspending of several years in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ole Slorer\n",
    "\n",
    "And just to understand the need for maintenance CAPEX, how much of that is tied to capacity loss in hole drilling equipment or other sort of businesses that are being reimbursed by your customers versus things you need to do on your own?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I mean, we are including the lost-in-hole. Now I can't give you a number how much of the 400 million we are guiding to next year as lost-in-hole at this point. But this year's CAPEX includes normal replacement and next year's CAPEX will do the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "And the easy answer maybe simply is that $400 million of net lost-in-hole [indiscernible]. It is easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",

    "That is a good question. On two separate tracks, when we finish cleaning up all the administrative problems we have had, the next step was taking stock of the fact that company was very inefficient because the distractions also had entered a number of bad contracts also because of distraction. Now, what we see on the bad contracts, I think with Zubair with no offense to the people working on Zubair are hard to finish it was a terrible contract. That is a loss [ph] contract they need and didn’t qualify it in the Middle East. And that contract is coming to an end operationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The progress you are seeing is essentially the slow but methodical quarter-by-quarter climb from reentering markets, reintroducing product lines, using our infrastructure to remain intact throughout our decline into various markets that have been leased. It is not only Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, all the other countries I mentioned Hawaii [ph] to Oman, Qatar, Egypt, Algeria which we almost exited not that long ago is rebuilding step by step. It is steps ready to factor that is driving it. With the end of Zubair, there are no other sort of bad contracts so these terrible years, 2012 to 2013. 2011, 2012, and 2013 for us to digest finished.\n",

    "Good morning guys. I agree with all like congratulations, it’s -- any improvement are nice improvements. Bernard last year you won this big contract in Brazil and Brazil has been just a basket case for business and investors. You got well construction and managed pressure drilling down there. Rumors are that Petrobras is going to cut another 10 rigs who knows. Can you talk about that, that’s been one of your good markets, can you talk about the risk you see in Brazil over the next year or two and the impact to Weatherford?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a risk reality Jim. I’ll make it simple for you, we are supposed to quadruple our presence in I’ll just focus on MPD and the rest is very similar. Let's just call it going from 3 strings to 12 strings. We’ll go from 3 strings to 6 strings end of story that’s it. And this is happening this year. Otherwise the growth is not there. And so as you could imagine there was some measure of giving up of infrastructure and everything else which classic problem for oil service companies. We have to manage that. Now mind you going from 3 to 6 is better than going from 3 to 0, I am very clear. But going to 3 to 6 and 3 to 12 are two entirely different things. Rigs were cancelled simple as that.\n",
    "\n",
    "James Wicklund\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay and if rigs get cancelled do we go from 6 to 3 to 0?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "No, I think it is actually sustainable. No, it is sustainable Jim, I am giving you the end result is bad enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "James Wicklund\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, my follow up if I could Q1 Q4 somewhere in there will be the fundamental bottom. But you are still cutting people and decision was made in September to cut another 3000 people, that would make me wonder what's your trajectory is of the recovery following the bottom in Q1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Good question again. Look the 14,000 actually as we speak today although we’ve acted only a little bit over 12,000. Already the balance has been named so we actually it is already identified and we would probably end up a little bit higher than 14,000 by year end. So I do think that the reduction in employment exercise is coming to an end. I think what you’ll see forward are surgical actions in particular locations, particular product lines. And you see us also posing lot on the supply chain both from a procurement standpoint where there is a lot that we are doing that we never did at least not as well. And also on the manufacturing side, on the rationalizing the manufacturing side that will be less I think spectacular in terms of numbers that we announced. But much very powerful and very surgical. Also you should see us in terms of employment expanding our talent bench in certain product lines and on the contrary go in the opposite direction in other product lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding we don’t see growth at all for the sake of growth. I mean what we really want, what you ought to focus on quarter-after-quarter is not -- you will do what you want, not so much revenue growth although we may get that too since focus on what we are trying to get done in the operating income level, at the debt reduction level, and at the cash flow levels. So, it is profitability cash flow that we’re interested in. Now next year and for the foreseeable future, it isn't necessarily the top line or put another way we want to grow aggressively certain product lines. We may not care that much about whether it translates in overall growth of the company. We may pull back from some but push much harder on others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Well Jim, I just want to add something, we are aggressively working on rationalizing our support structure. The remaining headcount reductions are going to be focused on support. We spoke a lot about our support ratio. We want to bring it to the mid 30s, right. We are still at 41.5, so that does not affect our ability to ramp up when activity picks up. It affects how we support that activity, how we can stretch the resources to support higher level of activity and become more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I am saying is it is not a comment, the extra headcount reduction is not a comment on that activity is going to plummet or anything like that. It is more rationalization offer and Jim focus on one last number. We are at 41.5% support ratio and we are trying to get to 35. Bear in mind 18 months ago we were at 60. That’s right.\n",

    "Bear in mind they are very hard to improve your support ratio when direct coming down so softly. Much easier to improve your support ratio when direct are expanding with volume.

    "Good morning James.\n",
    "\n",
    "James West\n",
    "\n",
    "And let me -- I would also like to echo Jim in all those comments about well executed quarter. It is clear that, the things you guys do internally are really started to pay off. My first question was really on MENA, you talked about a lot of contract wins in MENA and rearranged some markets or reintroducing some product lines, are you having to give up significant pricing to get back in or is this more of hey, we are going from three to two and we want you back. Or hey, Weatherford thank you for coming back. I mean what is driving those -- the market share gains there?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "What's driving it I think is the lack of point which is we have a very large infrastructure that has been underutilized, that kind of no fit [ph]. We have quite large market shares and number of product lines that, the client even remembers this also, had also mentioned we are the new kid on the block. We actually have a player who has not come back and could reassume the position it once held for many, many years.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in terms of trying to understanding who we are and what we are trying to do, it is easier than if it was a new entry, that's number one. Two, pricing; yes, of course. Pricing in general in MENA has dropped, not remotely as much as everywhere else, of course not. But we, I wouldn’t, none of the contracts and understanding, none of the contracts are major contracts, just have a lot of them and there is progress everywhere and they are stepping stones. To my knowledge none of the ones that we have incrementally in all those markets. I mean at a variance to where pricing is right now in the marketplace we are fortunate to meet pricing. I don’t think there is a variance to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not actually a price components or particular difficult issue to overcome. I understand also because we have an infrastructure in place. Everything else plus the incremental operating economics are very quickly good because you don’t have to set up shop. One of the things Weatherford has, it has and I think you know this, it has a vast infrastructure internationally which was part of the reason why we spend so much CAPEX in the years past. There are other reasons too, which I think we discussed earlier on. But this infrastructure can be put to good use. And what it requires particularly internationally is volume and we are getting some volume now in MENA and therefore the economics will improve simply because of economies of scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "James West\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, that makes sense. And then Bernard you are talking about the North Sea and the Caspian being up in the fourth quarter which typically I would think about as a seasonally weak quarter for those areas given the weather issues you have faced. Is there risk to that call or are these mainly kind of product sales type actions that are going to happen regardless of adverse weather conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, if weather is terrible it is only in North Sea also in Caspian, [indiscernible]. So if weather is terrible in both places, more terrible than they normally should be of course things always will be delayed is absolutely true. I don’t think the whole quarter is based on this business moving from Q3 to Q4. It is just that, incrementally it improves Q4 and incrementally weakens Q3 that's all, that's the margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of North Sea, you are talking about a series of service business actually going from one string to five strings, this is one. It is in well construction and involves a number of services inclusive of managed special drilling. From one to five it is supposed to be in Q3 and then in Q4 and it is happening as we speak, alright. Again it is not -- it is very much the same thing. Client adjourned a number of drilling and I think remediation assignments from Q3 to Q4. I don’t think oil had anything to do with it. It is just client decision. That is also happening as a matter of cost. So I will leave the whole Eastern Hemisphere will rise or fall based on movement of these contracts. I do think that it is happening as we speak notwithstanding whether it could disrupt operations and I think it is just notable because it will make Q4 the way Q3 should have been and maybe vice versa, okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "James West\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, got it. If I can slip one last one for Krishna, the 400 million in maintenance CAPEX, is that inclusive of land rigs and if you have the number for land rigs, could you share it with us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it does include land rigs. And from a rigs business perspective our mandate to the business guys is to run the business profitably through the year and to be cash positive right through the year. And that we have achieved this year. It will continue into next year as well. Now obviously the rig utilization rate is more challenged today, than it was a year ago. So it’s quite easy to manage the maintenance CAPEX going forward and be cash positive for the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "If I may add something there, we don’t take contracts particularly one involves moving rigs and unless the contracts has years and so we won't take its focus at the time because in the market which we have concentration of rigs already and have mobilization or compensation which is an offer we have not cash out of pocket to finance. So we are rather stringent about IT which also explains why rigs are not a consumer of cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorry Jim I am not going to give you a number on the call but it is going to be cash positive for the year the business. That’s the mandate and they will stay that right.\n",
    "\n",
    "James West\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay and do you still have I guess sort of slip one more in here, is there still the residual to IPO that business over the next year or so when the margin comes back. I mean you are still thinking that way about the 100 business?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "James, we are I think I’ll just say that the market has to be there. I am talking about the oil and therefore financial markets otherwise we are wasting our time. Remember we setup rigs in a separate entity. They are there on audit going back three years from our auditors KPMG. They’re there on information system segregated. They are there on the accounting system segregated. They are there on management only up to the leader and so it and they are on balance sheet if you will, if you want to peel it out its ready. Now the fact is ready is of course good. When will it be actually acted upon its really not us. It is purely activity, oil, etc. So the answer is yes, absolutely, whether it’s in a year or two years I don’t know but it is ready, yes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Angie Sedita\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks, good morning guys. I certainly called settlement to the brothers and doesn’t need to be said again but on the cash flow when you talk about the Baird could you talk a little bit more granular about where you stand in the project, thoughts on timing in 2016, and what is left on the performance targets which is completed so far and what remains. And then also on your cash flow target for 2016, does that include any recovery from the extra claims and the change orders?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Angie, first of all Zubair is just a term for six basically trains that we have to deliver to the customer and all -- each of the six trains is identical. Out of the six trains we finished mechanical completion for 5 of the 6 trains and handed it over to the customer. And the 6th is a mechanical completion is estimated before the end of the year. On the next two deadlines, milestones which is ready for completion RFC and then PAC which is the final deadline for the first five trains we expect RFC to be completed again before the end of the year for the first five trains with back early January of 2016. There is very little work to be done between RFC and PAC just running the facility for 30 days effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "And for the last site, the sixth site we expect RFC and PAC in Q1. There are milestone payments associated with achieving these milestones and these factor into the detailed cash flow projections that I spoke about earlier in my prepared comments. Now we have been conservative and assumed some sort of settlement with our customer on claims that we’ve had which are in arbitration today. We are discussing with them actively on an out of court if you will settlement. We don’t know what that number is going to be, it is still being negotiated back and forth. But there will be a positive injection into cash flow. I’ve been conservative to say that year-over-year from 2015 to 2016 Zubair will be 200 million differential cash flow positive in 2016. That’s a conservative number I am very comfortable with it based on the milestone dates and like the outcome of the settlement discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Angie Sedita\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, that’s just really very, very helpful. And then separately or going directionally elsewhere on the U.S. and pricing, can you talk about obviously pressure pumping is ugly on the pricing side but as far as pricing in your other segments in Q3, your product lines artificial lift completion what are you seeing there, can you talk about your other product lines across the spectrum?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the short answer Angie is that although you have had instances of going both ways for the most part excluding pressure pumping and rentals, I think pricing is essentially flattened, bottomed across the Board. There are few trends here and there but on balance it is correct. If you want something on the positive side as evidenced in official list on the one hand we ourselves coming to the end of our selling inventories which were from a cost perspective and the higher cost structure than we are able to manufacture today. So that is one issue which is positive for us meaning that everything being equal you end up having higher margins on the same sale. We expect that to start occurring in Q1. Not in Q4 but in Q1.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time there is evidence of the clients destocking. In another words they finished their destocking programs, and officially if you need to use up the equipment by and large and there are exceptions Angie but by and large used equipment, pumps and pumping units and all manners of tools that are involved in official list process. As evidenced that on average our clients are efficiently stocking. So put all that together which is from a cost perspective you have improvements just naturally from our side simply from having liquidated by year-end the higher cost inventory which we’re hosting on the market, I would disciplined. And at the same time clients having to buy more because their inventory has been liquidated. I would say actually that is already occurring right now. So we’d say certainly by year-end possibly already by Q4.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that sort of factor which is significant for us but overall pricing with the exception of pressure pumping and perhaps rental tools but pressure pumping even more so, I think the rest in pricing and at least we can observe in North America is sitting on the low which is not weakening further. These are my observation.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Hey, good morning.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Good morning Sean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sean Meakim\n",
    "\n",
    "So just in a similar range, you talked a lot about the smaller competitors in pressure pumping and their cash flow stress and we look at some of the other product lines we just going through, a lift rentals thing like that are you seeing smaller folks exit the market, is the competitive landscape shifting at all as you go through the downturn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "It is really a -- I think it’s a legitimate -- whole question is legitimate but strategically legitimate questions rentals and pressure pumping. So yes, we see small players that are either going out of business or come down such low level of utilization that it is just not the same thing. Do not hold much hope though because of barriers to entry in both those product lines is still low. We do not subscribe to the notion that equivalent to that fact does not come back, doesn’t agree with at all. Truly equivalent to the fact whether its rental equipment or pressure pumping was even a bigger problem would require some refurbishment. Refurbishment is a fraction of the replacement cost. And then one of the problems of those two businesses and clearly were the ones to be emphasizing because again we are not interested particularly in size, interested in profitability and cash contribution now and later. Well bigger problem with those product lines is the barrier to entry is so low. Now you can excel at it from an efficiency standpoint. There are some technologies that are helpful but by and large it has got very low barriers to entry and that’s not going to change. So I don’t see although there are smaller players that are being pushed out and so forth they will be coming back. I don’t doubt that on the different ownership. It does not imply to artificial lift up. Because the lift is not at all the case, that’s entirely different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sean Meakim\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s very helpful and then just on international where do you think we are in terms of the cycle for pricing pressure, how should we think about how to look just down turn to the prior one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's be careful. International facilities, lot of different regions. The other thing I would say is segregate it also what markets in terms of the types of environment you are drilling in. I mean deepwater is going to be different from offshore, it is going to be different from land. If land got hit early and got hit bad I think land in general with maybe exceptions in Latin America from a pricing standpoint is essentially dull. I think the pain that is coming internationally will be primarily in deepwater. Deepwater economics I am told by a number of clients in simplistic terms doesn’t work below $70 rent. Now it is still really simplistic. Obviously it just doesn’t work and so that all expect exploration and deepwater to be hit bad and therefore pricing clearly will deteriorate there for whomever is playing in those markets and all of us are to varying degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than Latin America in simplistic terms I think you are down on pricing by and large. There may be some pockets of weaknesses still in Latin America I don’t believe that many. And I don’t have -- and actually offshore as in -- not that different I think from land also. It’s really deepwater exploration I think where the bulk of the volume declines unless oil corrects quickly, volume declines and therefore pricing associated with whatever is left in terms of business will be the harshest to go through now.\n",
    "\n",
    "And don’t make what I am about to say to a badge of Obama but this isn't a market exploration we don’t play and the deepwater we do play but it is not our strongest market at all, never was. As you know we are land people and to a degree shop people.\n",

    "\n",
    "Kurt Hallead\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, thank you, good morning. You guys went and threw a lot of good stuff and detail here. I was just wondering on the free cash flow dynamic if you can pass out a bit more on working capital and maybe refresh some of the targets you might have for receivables and inventory, etc?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, every quarter this year we’ve generated positive cash flow from working capital and it will not change in Q4. Q4 is usually a pretty decent quarter for customer actions Kurt. So DSO we expect will certainly reduce from Q3 to Q4 as it did during Q3 as well with the focus we are putting on it. Inventory continues to go down with the focus we are putting on it. I think Bernard talked about artificial lift, he is talking on our side that has been the real focus for us as of the other product lines completions included. So inventory should reduce nicely in fact over the next two or three quarters I would say continuously until we hit some activity inflection at some point in 2016. Those are the two big movers we are working at. I think there is no reasons for us to believe that we cannot continue to generate -- if the activity at revenue level is flattened then yes, I mean at some point the working capital will start to flatten as well. But then earnings will increase dramatically with incrementals that will help us quite a lot given the factors I mentioned earlier. So they will balance off against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kurt Hallead\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, that’s great, I appreciate that explanation. And then the comments you made about maintenance CAPEX and levels of maintenance CAPEX needed and the duration of which you can operate effectively, is that the game plan for 2016 to operate at maintenance CAPEX or is that just a reference point in a very extreme situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "So it’s a game plan and it is not only the game plan for 2016 it is also the game plan at the current moment we are looking at 2017. It is just based on how much excessive footprint we have around the world across all product lines. So you would have to see an incredible activity increase to mop that up quicker than 2017. So it is a game plan and it is very achievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kurt Hallead\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay and then one last thing then as it relates to the comments you made about the debt and the covenants and everything else I just want to make sure I understood the point you are trying to make in your minds based on your financial position and the conservations you may be having with some of the creditors. You are of the view point that you’re rating for your debt should not remain unchanged, is that how we should understand your comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the rating agencies will take a view on the sector as a whole and if they take a draconian view of the sector I think every company in the sector will be re-rated and we are just investment grade today. So, I would not hold my breath and say we are going to retain that for the longest time. If they changed the ratings in all the companies within the sector certainly we will be affected by it. But the impact of that will not be material at all on Weatherford as I explained earlier. So, it definitely it doesn’t affect us dramatically.\n",

    "In terms of covenants by the way I went through the entire calculation in quite a lot of detail Kurt because if you just take a facile calculation from our 10-Q balance sheet you could reach very quickly very wrong conclusions. And I just wanted to make sure people understood that the covenant is a defined, it is a definition, it is a negotiated term in our contract and that is what I was trying to explain. Something that is not obvious from our 10-Q filings.\n",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Weatherford International Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Karen David-Green, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Marketing and Communications. You may begin your conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Karen David-Green\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, Laurie, good morning and welcome to the Weatherford International fourth quarter conference call. With me on today's call from Geneva we have Bernard Duroc-Danner, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Krishna Shivram, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Weatherford's website for 10 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin with our opening comments I'd like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our fourth quarter press release that can be found on our website for the customary caution on forward-looking statements and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now I'd like to hand the call over to Krishna.\n",

    "Krishna Shivram\n",

    "Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a brief recap of our operating performance in the fourth quarter. Loss per share for the quarter before charges and credits was $0.13. Revenue of $2.01 billion for the quarter decreased 10% sequentially and 46% year on year. Operating income margins before R&D and corporate expenses declined by 255 basis points sequentially to 2.8%. Excluding the rigs business our core business revenue decreased 9% sequentially with a 115 basis point deterioration in operating income margins to 3.9%. These margins do not benefit from any of the asset or other impairment charges recorded this quarter as these impairments were accounted as of December 31. In other words, the margins reflect the tightly run operations and cost management actions, something Bernard will touch on later.\n",
    "\n",
    "North America revenue declined 15% sequentially, in line with the reduction in rig count coupled with continued pricing pressures with operating income margins dipping 312 basis points to negative 9.6%. International revenue reduced sequentially by 4.9%, marginally better than each of our larger peers, while operating income margins decreased slightly by 80 basis points to 12.1%. Eastern Hemisphere results were resilient in the face of activity and pricing reductions with revenue dipping only 2% sequentially, comfortably beating our peers, while margins improved 20 basis points to remain steady at 10.6%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Latin America revenue declined 11% and margins dropped by 245 basis points to 15.2%, reflecting client led spending cuts in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico coupled with our self-imposed reductions in activity in Venezuela and Ecuador. In the Europe/Caspian/Russia/sub-Sahara Africa region, revenue was down 7% reflecting seasonal winter declines in Russia and the North Sea, coupled with project cancellations across sub-Sahara Africa principally in Angola, while margins remain resilient at 11.4% as proactive cost management offset the impact of revenue declines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The revenue in the Middle East and Asia Pacific region grew 2% with a 64 basis point improvement in margins to 10%, with advances in Kuwait, China, Indonesia, Oman, Malaysia and Abu Dhabi more than offsetting declines in Iraq. Overall margins were positively impacted by our continued proactive cost management actions across all the regions. Our Land Drilling Rigs business recorded a 22% sequential revenue decline with the end of several drilling projects across the Middle East and North Africa region, mainly in Chad, Kuwait and India. The rigs business slipped to an operating loss of $17 million as cost reduction actions were not quick enough to stem the loss of revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below operating margins R&D costs reduced by $4 million while corporate costs were flat. Our budget for 2016 comprises cutting nonessential projects to reduce R&D spend to $150 million for the full year. Corporate costs will also be reduced to $150 million for the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter reflected the tax benefit on the losses in the U.S., partly offset by tax provisions internationally where we continue to be profitable. The tax rate for 2016 will be dependent on the geographical mix of earnings and will be heavily weighted by results in the U.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth quarter results include after-tax charges of $1.1 billion which includes impairment of asset and inventory carrying values, mainly in the United States, in the pressure pumping and rental tool businesses due to the low activity levels. In addition, several international rigs which are idle and not likely to sign contracts in the foreseeable future, were also impaired. The bulk of these charges are non-cash in nature and reflect the difficult operating conditions of the current down cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also conducted our normal annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter. As always, a detailed analysis was prepared in consultation with external experts and this analysis was stringently tested. The conclusion was that there was no impairment of goodwill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the sudden deterioration of commodity prices most recently and as a matter of abundant caution, we updated our projections and analysis and retested the goodwill for potential impairment. Again the conclusion was that there was no impairment of goodwill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to net debt and cash flow now, net debt reduced by $191 million to reach $6.994 billion at the end of the year. This was the first time our net debt has dipped below $7 billion since March 2011. Free cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $168 million resulting in a positive full-year free cash flow number of $129 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "CapEx in the fourth quarter was high at $140 million, about $32 million higher than previously forecast. In order to preserve key vendor relationships we took and paid for deliveries from vendors that had been delayed for several quarters. Cash severance costs paid in Q4 amounted to $43 million which was $23 million higher than anticipated, mainly as a result of quicker execution of our headcount reduction program. Without these two cash overruns our free cash flow for Q4 would have been $223 million. Both items will benefit free cash flow in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working capital generated $250 million of liquidity this quarter and $567 million for the year, with strong customer collections and a lower yearend DSO compared with any of our peers, coupled with a significant drop in inventory balances of $743 million for the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zubair project was cash positive in the fourth quarter as several milestones were achieved triggering cash payments as per contract. Overall at the company level this was the first time we have generated positive free cash flow for the full year since 2010 in spite of much more challenging business conditions. As of December 31, available liquidity was $1.7 billion, meaning we have a large borrowing cushion available to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would now like to offer a view on free cash flow in 2016. We expect to generate between $600 million and $700 billion of free cash flow in 2016, taking our net debt at the end of this year well below $6.5 billion and a targeted net debt level of below $6 billion by the end of 2017. Our long term net debt target is $4 billion which will get nearer when we sell the rigs business once market conditions improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four key variables that give us enough confidence to protect free cash flow at between $600 million and $700 million for 2016. The first variable is the net cash flow from the Zubair EPF contract in Iraq. As of today, all of six trains have achieved mechanical completion and five of the six trains have achieved the next milestone RFC or ready for commissioning, milestone. We have also successfully introduced hydrocarbons in three of the trains.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a clear line of sight on the final milestones which will trigger additional contractual payments. We also expect to reach a settlement on change order claims after contract completion. As 2015 was a net cash flow negative year for this project, the year-over-year swing is expected to be in the range of $200 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second key variable is cash severance and restructuring cost. In 2015 we spent $193 million in cash. In 2016, given the reduced level of headcount reduction of 6,000 versus 14,000, we expect to not exceed $80 million, meaning that year on year we will have an improvement of about $110 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third key variable is capital expenditure. Based on the quantity of excess equipment we carry at year end, we do not envisage any growth CapEx for 2016 even if activity levels increase. As a result of the acceleration of CapEx spend into Q4 of 2015 with a higher acceptance of [indiscernible] deliveries; we have reduced the CapEx budget for $2016 to $300 million which is roughly the maintenance CapEx level we need for the estimated operating activity levels. If activity levels reduce further we have the ability to dial back CapEx even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the back of reducing CapEx by 53% in 2015 versus 2014, we have developed a strong review and approval process which forces equipment sharing and intensifies utilization. The value of approved but unspent AFEs going into 2016 is 81% lower than 12 months ago which should allow us to comfortably meet the $300 million target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last key variable is inventory. Despite a relatively large pipeline of vendor orders coming into 2015 from 2014, we managed to reduce inventory balances by $743 million in 2015. Our target for 2016 is to reduce inventory balances by a further $550 million, generating cash in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a low vendor order pipeline going into 2016 which is 66% lower in value compared with 12 months ago and a systematic process to approve new orders while encouraging sharing among locations, we believe this target can be achieved with relative ease. These four variables, namely the Zubair contract, cash severance cost, CapEx and inventory reductions, are factors within our control and relatively independent of business conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you at the impact of these four variables together, the incremental cash flow in 2016 versus 2015 is about $500 million. We're confident that variations in earnings and accounts receivable should nullify each other. Given the free cash flow for 2015 was $129 million, adding the $500 million on the key variables will provide - that the key variables will provide allow us to realistically target a free cash flow goal of between $600 billion and $700 million in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that the free cash flow performance in 2015, the available liquidity at year end and the expected free cash flow number for 2016 should allow access to more than enough cash to repay both the maturity of $350 million this month and the June 2017 debt maturity of $600 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would now like to update you on our short term credit facilities. You will remember that our current facility expires in July 2017. Having said that, it is good practice to proactively address the replacement of this facility early, we will launch a new facility shortly after this earnings call, maintaining the overall size at $2.25 billion, but extending the facility out over the next three to four years.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have ongoing discussions with our bank group with respect to the terms and conditions of such an extended facility and we're confident we can conclude this new facility by the end of the first quarter. Also, purely as a measure of abundant precaution and mostly to reassure our equity holders, we have successfully renegotiated the covenant on our current revolving credit facility from a 60% debt to cap ratio to a 70% ratio. At the end of the year the calculated debt to cap ratio, including the extraordinary asset and inventory impairment charges taken in Q4, is 55.6%. This includes a $1.6 billion adjustment for the accumulated currency impact on nonmonetary non-U.S. dollar assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, all our assets, including goodwill, were tested stringently for impairment in Q4, resulting in an after-tax charge of $1.1 billion. Without this impairment charge the covenant calculation would have been 51.4% which is slightly better compared to the third quarter. Nevertheless, the newly negotiated covenant of 70% leaves ample headroom of about $2.8 billion to trigger the new covenant. This means that there is no realistic possibility of a covenant breach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We enjoy an excellent working relationship with our banking group and this is evidenced by the unanimous acceptance of the recent change in our debt to cap covenant. We anticipate no difficulty in renegotiating and extending out our short term financing facility. I would like to also remind you that our long term bonds totaling $5.8 billion at year end represent 77% of our total debt and do not carry any debt to cap or any other ratio driven covenants. With that I will now turn the call over to Bernard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, Krishna and good morning, everyone. It is difficult to describe a quarter in which we remain unprofitable and with large asset impairment as successful, but operationally it was. The obsessive focus and discipline on core, cost, cash is paying dividends and will continue to do so. Our direction won't move an inch. The drive and intensity will only increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decrementals are a good metric of operational performance. Decrementals overall were 28.1% on 10% sequential decline in revenues. Without rigs the core decrementals were 16.6% on 9% declined revenues which is just about best in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our performance was a tale of two hemispheres. The Eastern Hemisphere was essentially flat both on revenues and operating income which is best in class. We gained share in a wide cross-section of the Hemisphere and stringent cost cuts of prior quarters helped. Both factors made up for continued market erosion and severe pricing pressures which are widespread in the Eastern Hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Eastern Hemisphere is a growing area of relative strength for Weatherford. The revenues and profitability declines occurred in Western Hemisphere, both NAM and Latin America. North America did markedly better than Latin America. North America reported a 15% decline in revenues but held the decrementals to 10.9%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outstanding decrementals are a reflection of structural changes brought about in the operations. North America has been entirely reorganized and transformed. Its costs, operating practices and talent benched forged a new operation. The results of the prior four quarter's relentless drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latin America stood out as the low performer with a 10.6% decline in revenues and a punitive 38.4% detrimental. The explanation was in part a further market weakening in Colombia and Brazil, but by far the larger factor was a self-imposed reduction in activity in Venezuela and Ecuador. Venezuela alone was half the quarterly revenue decline and more than all the profitability decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, Argentina and some of the smaller regional markets continue to grow. Put another way, Latin America's Q4 reflect primarily self-imposed discipline more so than performance. In fact, without our Venezuela and Ecuador purposeful pullback the region would have shown level profitability on Q3 or slightly up, very much like Eastern Hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking stock of the full-year 2015, two markers of how much the company has changed and performed. The year-on-year 2015 on 2014 operating income decrementals were held at 28.1% on 36.7% revenue declines. This is ignoring the effects of foreign exchange on revenues, incidentally. By comparison 2009 on 2008 decrementals were 153.6%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, in a year of massive decline and reduction in force, Weatherford achieved its highest metric for employee safety worldwide in its recorded history. Safety achievements are seldom compatible with the disruptions of retrenchment. The safety is a proxy for quality and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will focus the rest of my comments on three areas, further operating underpinnings of the Q4 results; forward views and our direction; and the endpoint for transformation of the company. Operation underpinnings of Q4 - rather than a superficial oversight of all regions in Q4, I want to provide granularity on North America as an illustration of the transformation of Weatherford. I'll focus more specifically on the U.S. while the same commentary could be made on the Canadian operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "NAM's outstanding decremental performance was earned through the systematic transformation of our operating organization. The driving factors were - cost cuts; we were early and we went deep and we didn't pause. Yearend 2015 versus yearend 2014 we lowered our payroll and headcount by 41%. This quarter in Q1 we're taking down another 15% of our U.S. headcount, meaning that from January 1, 2015 to date or just about 15 months at the end of Q1, we'll have lowered our U.S. headcount and payroll by 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we addressed goes beyond lowering headcount. We delayered the organization, rationalized facilities infrastructure and upgraded the talent bench both internally and through outside hires. Specifically we rationalized the infrastructure with a total of 126 facility closures. There's another 25 or so scheduled for Q1. We went from seven sub regions to three and we moved from five reporting operating layers from regional leaders to the well site to an average of three.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the payroll reduction numbers it is the structure and the culture of operations which has been fundamentally changed. The other thing we worked on is product line focus. Close to half of the sequential revenue decline in Q4 for NAM was with pressure pumping and drilling tools, otherwise known as rentals. This decline was one of choice; we purposefully scaled back operations for those two product lines and therefore share.\n",
    "\n",
    "By all measurement we continue to gain share steadily in our other product lines which is the intent here - for here and now and highly desirable long term. The stark reality that with our pressure pumping NAM in Q4 will be close to profitable even in this deep depression. In fact, with our pressure pumping and drilling tools which together combined in Q4 still add up to about 20% of our NAM revenues, NAM will be profitable and compared to the operating income margins of our larger peer group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases the pressure pumping and rigs tools, there are essentially no barriers to entry, vast over supply of equipment and unsustainably punitive economics. We won't pursue contracts that have punitive returns, we don't have to and we won't; we would rather let others do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're doing fundamental efficiency work in the U.S. addressing the structural as well as the cyclical and the talent bench. The U.S. will be a transformed operation when we're finished, should expect this trend to continue in the first half of this year. We're ready to address any market conditions both to manage down decrementals in the event of further market declines in the first half of 2016 and exploit large incremental gains when the recovery comes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're in the midst of the same operating changes internationally as we have effected in NAM. You should expect the same results which brings me to the outlook for the first half of 2016 - or the outlook for 2016 altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall market and [indiscernible] results will be weaker in Q1 than in Q4 in both NAM and the international markets. First, seasonality suggests a lower Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America and is always the case in the first quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second are the consequences of oil pricing. We will experience in all markets further volume declines and pricing pressures. We're ready for this. We're addressing both with continuing to aggressively managing down our cost structure and a very focused product line strategy by geographic market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming $25 to $30 average pricing for the first half of the year, that is for oil of course, we believe our Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America operations will trough in Q1. We expect Eastern Hemisphere to seasonally recover some in Q2. Latin America will also, but it will be a slower and more pained recovery. Still, international in our judgment will trough in Q1 and we expect Eastern Hemisphere to remain in Q2 and there on an island of relative strength for the balance of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rig operations will see modest improvements in financial results most likely by late Q2 there on. By midyear a number of stacked rigs will have been mobilized on location and operating. This will lead to better results for the second half of the year. Our rig operations remain segregated from the core in management, operations, IT and financial results all the way to separate audits. They remain a non-core asset which we nonetheless manage very carefully. They will be divested when market conditions improve, the proceeds will be used to further delever the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have set as an internal target to reach earnings breakeven by Q3 based on cuts in 2016 and carryover from 2015 as well as Eastern Hemisphere performance. This will be a hard objective to achieve given what we expect the marketplace, but one we believe is achievable. Free cash flow remains an unyielding priority. The range of free cash flow for 2016, as Krishna mentioned, will be $600 million to $700 million. Net debt by year end will decline to well under $6.5 billion. The objective is well understood, planned for and prioritized by all in the organization, both financial and operations. We will deliver this level of free cash flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our direction is clear to all within Weatherford. We're changing the rules of engagement in all of our business dealings. We're focused on core cost cash, we build on our operating progress to date with more efficiency, cash discipline, systematic talent upgrades and selected market share focus. We delever at the balance sheet through free cash flow quarter after quarter with no exceptions and eventually with more divestments. This is our direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our action centers around improving four things and doing so in a perennial way. Lower cost structure through cycles, capital allocation and cash generation as a companywide discipline, leapfrog talent bench and talent development as a culture focused on quality and reliability for all product lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will summarize some of the accomplishments in 2015 and the work in progress for 2016. Reduction in force, reduce our payroll overall by 41% over 2014 and 2015. As a reminder, we had 67,400 employees on January 1, 2014; 55,400 on January 1, 2015; and we stand at 39,500 employees at year end 2015. We will reduce our employment further by 6,000 positions to 33,500; this will get done in Q1 and completed before the end of Q2.\n",
    "\n",
    "We took down our support ratio from 59% in 2014 to where it presently stands at 38.0%. A 21% decline in support ratio is a colossal structural change in record time. To do this during a cyclical downturn is doubly difficult. It is also a structural change that will provide us with outsized incremental margins through the recovery years. We'll push down further our support ratio to 35%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations will streamline with consolidation of geographic segments, flattening of the reporting organization, scaling down regional headquarters and push the country closer to the sand face. Supply chain initiated a two-year restructuring of productivity leapfrog; manufacturing, logistics and procurement are in the midst of a fundamental productivity and efficiency change. This is an economic breakthrough for our operating cost structure and flexibility of adjustment to changes in business volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here comes a synthesis of all the work done in 2015 on the cost side. So acted upon cost cuts in 2015 add up to $984 million cost cuts in headcount and $402 million in supply chain and facility closures. We add them together that is in total $1.386 billion of which just over half has been realized in 2015 because of timing. The full balance or roughly $650 million, will accrue 2016 results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving over to the balance sheet, inventory declined by about $600 million before any book impairment. We expect similar reduction of inventories in 2016. We remain long equipment and inventories as we enter 2016. Receivables are run with the tightest control. You will find that our Q4 and year end DSO's are best in class amongst our peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Krishna mentioned, CapEx was cut by 55% in 2015 to $650 million; we will take them down to $300 million in 2016. And R&D will be cut by 35% from $230 million to $150 million, preserving only essential technological research. With the exception of R&D which can be caught up quickly with a recovery, we're not cutting into muscle. We entered the depression with a large pool of excess equipment and heavy organizational structure. Much of what we're doing is as much perennial efficiency transformation than volume-related direct cost adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we're continuously adding muscle by high grading our talents. We're, in fact, constantly acting our new hires into now internal promotions for operating positions worldwide to strengthen our bench. This also reaches out to senior operating management levels. By the end of Q1 we will bring on as an officer a new leader for our product lines to complete the senior operating team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Product lines require a number of focal points with the most critical centering around quality and reliability. At the other end of the spectrum, this year we're hiring upwards of 500 new graduates from engineering schools around the world. It is an ongoing commitment which we will do in good and in bad years, they are the future of the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weatherford is in the midst of a transformation from cost structure, cooperating practices and quality focus, returns objectives and a culture of sales, we're a completely different company in the making. Our performance in this trough through the first half 2016 will bear this out on all metrics. Our performance and recovery will surprise to the upside. Our incrementals will stand out like our decrementals did.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our synthesis - a word about the macro, the oil industry, as you know, is massively underfunded and massively underinvested. It defies the imagination what is going on in reservoirs around the world. Pessimism rules in all aspects of analysis and interpretation. Yet if current oil pricing and oil selectivity endure, the industry will not be able to manage required oil demand as early as 2017. This means oil demand would not be met by existing oil capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing oil capacity just about equates to existing production rates. Inventory overhang will help; but by definition that isn't more than a stopgap solution. All this is a physical fact or - even though it has no effect on the psychology of oil pricing and forward curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The black swan issue is a possibility of a worldwide recession which would abruptly arrest the growth in oil demand. There is much focus on the sustainability of GNP growth rates in the various countries particularly all important China. And obviously worldwide recession would adjourn all considerations oilfield recovery for the duration of the recession.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the extent though there are no apparent factors that could precipitate a domino effect of country recessions and there is a web of stimulating counterbalancing factors, the obsessive focus from an oil standpoint ends up being on whether demand growth in 2016 will be 1 million barrels a day or 1.5 million barrels a day or anything in between. Those are important differences but they pale in comparison to the gathering storm of decline in production akin to declines in capacity. Other than a few barrels came from Iran. By our assessment the industry has no spare capacity beyond the present operating rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, elasticity of supply response is being ignored or overstated. In my 30 years in the oilfields and my prior years watching my father operate in same, I have never seen anything like it. At one level it is unthinkable; at another those are the choices made by market economy in response to geopolitical decisions. But even the latter will become soon enough academic when supply curve crosses demand on its way down with no immediate or obvious short term solutions to address it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It isn't all bad. The present state of industry depression offers us great opportunities. We're positioning Weatherford in a very focused industry segment, deemphasizing or exiting others, using our product line strength, infrastructure and specific technological leadership. We're using the brutal recession to fundamentally change our cost structure, quality, efficiency, returns culture and emphatically our talent bench.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a unique opportunity for us to make a quantum change, keeping what is good and promising at Weatherford, but fundamentally changing what wasn't. We're today already a very different company. Our operating and management capabilities are immeasurably stronger than they historically were. We have still a worldwide infrastructure of service support second to none.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're confident of our technological strength, product line breadth and market potential for organic growth. And finally, paramount to us in bad and good markets, we maintain a strong free cash flow and that will not change. Our numbers will prove out the merits of our direction in this brutal down cycle and just as much when the market turns. Our direction will deliver high shareholder returns at the lowest risk and this direction will not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that I will turn the call to the operator for Q&A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question-and-Answer Session\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bill Herbert\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna, could you run through the components of the free cash flow generation in 2016? Because it seems like you arrived at a $500 million number plus adding the $150 million thereabouts for 2015 to get to $650 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I think you said Zubair $200 million year-over-year positive delta for free cash flow, severance and restructuring severely reduced in 2016 versus 2015, so that is $110 million. Capital spending down $380 million. And then I thought you said inventory reduction of $550 million but then you - those four buckets you arrived at a net free cash flow increase of $500 million. Am I missing something or no?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Bill, basically I am saying that inventory will come down $550 million, but inventory came down in 2015 by $750 million. So, the net between the two years is lower liquidity from inventory by about $200 million. So that is your missing piece, all that you get $500 million and then you add the $129 million, we're very comfortable between the $600 million and $700 million number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bill Herbert\n",
    "\n",
    "$129 million, got it. And then the February debt maturity, that gets paid out of your credit facility or what?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it is going to be paid out of our credit facility next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bill Herbert\n",
    "\n",
    "And the amendments to your covenants and the extension of your credit facility, what does that do to your cost debt?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that is to be determined. We're going to work with our bankers in the next six weeks to put in place a longer term credit facility, as I said. And there will be the customary type of slew of guarantees and securities that are commensurate with our credit rating and the cost will be marginally higher. But it is not going to be material to Weatherford's results. We're talking in the - probably in the $10 million to $20 million annual range. So it is not really material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bill Herbert\n",
    "\n",
    "And then Bernard, back to your outlook, assuming that essentially when you roll up kind of national oil company and large natural resource holder international capital spending declines 2016, it seems as if - at least the early indications point to a 20% reduction year over year. Juxtapose sort of Weatherford's revenue performance against that benchmark, if you will. Why would it be better, why would it be worse, why would it be in line?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "First, if you just look at 20% decline, our rough judgment would be that we'd probably, just in terms of national share gains, pick up about half of the decline. In other words, if it is down 20% we'll probably be down 10%. This is the first judgment. Why? Simply because we have low market shares in a number of places which we're gradually inching back.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a continuation of what we have done. It really happens in the Eastern Hemisphere, happens in Latin America, ex-Venezuela and Ecuador which we in essence we're not - we have a very, very small presence in and will keep it small.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other factor and when we look at our assessment for 2016, is not a top-line factor, it is a cost factor. In reading the prepared comments it's always hard to be able to highlight the parts that are particularly useful. But when we count everything that we have done in 2015 and we're very honest about it, we have just under $1.4 billion of measurable - I mean really measurable cost action, $1.385 billion, exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we know that only just about $730 million were actually realized as we went through the P&L in 2015. So maybe it was the timing of these things. So we got a little over $650 million on the cost side which have been acted upon that are coming in now in January and February, etc., in 2016. And we're taking further actions as we're taking down 6,000 people more companywide and some more actions around supply chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the point being that a combination of natural share gains that are nothing spectacular, they are just - they are, at the end the dollars are not that large so we're not that large of a company at the end of the day. But in a number of areas we have unnaturally low market share.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is sort of a quite easy to gain if only because in the areas we specialize in we have good performance. And then you have that and then you have simply a very strong tailwind which is on the cost side, probably stronger than just about any other company's because we have been obsessive about it and we had more to cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bill Herbert\n",
    "\n",
    "Right. And the three markets, if memory serves with regard to your market share gains where you have essentially been marginalized or, for whatever reason, not nearly as active as you have been historically. Saudi, Algeria and Angola, are those the three?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, yes, I think you have - first of all it is Middle East are the primary ones. Not only the Middle East, but you have got pockets also in SSA, you are absolutely correct and you are spot on. You also have certain areas of Asia-Pacific also which is a very, very difficult market. I am not minimizing the difficulty of the market, it is quite the contrary. But within difficult markets you can have relative performance. And also we had very, very presence in Asia-Pacific in a few markets. I will tell you the management that we have in the field is - and I hope they are listening to this call - is immensely more talented than they ever were.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the drive in Asia-Pacific, the drive in the Middle East, just to name those two and also some other areas in the Eastern Hemisphere here and there, is [indiscernible] get back or get at least some market share and then we can. And the product lines are what you would expect, including services or formation evaluation, completion of course and well construction more so than lift.\n",

    "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ole Slorer\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna, just to clarify on the cost of - clearly most of the questions we get on most companies right now are centered around the balance sheet and financing and sustainability. So, sorry about getting back to that. But the $10 million to $20 million you specify, was that to do with the cost of changing the covenant from 60% to 70% or was it a total cost of that and what you expect to be the case on the $2.25 billion facility extension?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "No, it is anticipated increase in cost for the extension we're talking about. There was hardly any cost for the change from 60% to 70%, miniscule. So it is a range, okay, that is in our minds. But it has to be still negotiated and nailed down with the banking group. And we feel very comfortable that we will be able to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ole Slorer\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so you are comfortable that you can extend and incur an incremental cost within $10 million to $20 million. I think that would be a great relief for a lot of us. And when it comes to the cash flow, to what extent will the $500 million be backend loaded? Do you see any chance that you will be free cash flow positive in the first quarter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be marginally free cash flow positive in the first quarter. As you know, first quarter is always seasonally challenged not only from a results standpoint but also from a cash flow standpoint. As customers, mainly national oil company customers, they typically slow down payments to operating companies, to service companies and this year is no exception. And also you have a kind of a lot of payment for the prior year bonuses for employees and all the rest of it. Working capital does take a little bit of a hickey in the first quarter which is seasonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I do expect to be marginally cash flow positive in Q1 and then building up as the year goes on. If you look at our history, Q1 has always been the most challenged free cash flow quarter and this year is going to be no exception with the one difference being that we expect to be marginally positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ole Slorer\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that would be a very strong start if you can do that. Just finally, Bernard, just your thoughts on Iran, if you could share what opportunity you see for the international service industry or your kind of high-level thoughts on what can be easily done in Iran with respect to export capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Look, the capacity that Iran can operate at circles around 3.5 million barrels a day. Just before the opening of the markets, best of my knowledge, they were around 3.15 million giving a swing of 350,000 barrels a day. Then you get into issues of grade of oil and I wouldn't even belabor the point because there are issues of marketability of the oil. So that is 350,000 barrels looking for a home. Now it is also true that the 350,000 barrels a day is not really available from a production capacity. It will require a few months just to - because that 3.5 million barrels a day capacity is not truly functional, but it will be functional shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "More interestingly - that is actually a very, very small number. More interestingly to go above 3.5 million barrels a day for the next 500,000 barrels a day to the best of my knowledge - and I don't have a bias either ways, neither optimistic nor pessimistic, just realistic - you are talking at about not far from a couple of years, regardless of public pronouncements, to go from 3.5 million to 4 million. So if you want to be reasonable I think you could get there by the end of next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I would also say that given the nature of the reservoirs, their size, the level of fractionation that they have, their vintage or exploitation, I would say that my particular view and it is not my own - I am not the only one to have that view - is that on and around 4 million barrels a day Iran is capped. Iran is above all a gigantic gas cap, it is above all an issue of gas. Gas is an entirely different discussion for Iran.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mean very quickly, the time and attention and the capital and so forth and so on will be moved to gas and then oil will be an issue trying to keep production capacity in that range of 3.4 million to 4 million. Iran is not an oil issue, Iran is a gas issue and that is where the money is for them. And ultimately for the oilfield service industry will also be where the money will be made, it is all supporting the gas development, but that is a very long term discussion.\n",

    "My second question, Bernard, the transformations that you describe sound very impressive - a quantum change, you are a very different company. But you are the CEO. What changed in your outlook, your management focus? What caused you to make and start this transformation over the last two to three years after many years of running Weatherford?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "That is a very difficult question to answer in public, so I am just going to answer it as honestly as I can. Normally what happens when a company grows as fast as we have grown since 1987 from nothing and is very successful, possibly too successful and then of course discovers at some point in time it is not terribly well-managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The person that was responsible for the growth and everything else, but probably did not pay enough attention to how well it was being managed, is replaced and someone else comes in and doesn't have to answer that question. I au contraire get to answer the question which makes it a little bit difficult. So I will tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above all I want Weatherford to do well. This has nothing to do with me personally. I want Weatherford to do well. I know what Weatherford has and what it doesn't have. I know the wealth at Weatherford that is there to be harvested, I know what is missing. A little bit like one would know a child.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I realized all the trouble we went through and it was extraordinarily painful for our shareholders, for management too but for our shareholders above all, that was before oil declined, I realized what had to be done. And to the extent I am able to guide the company so that it does what needs to be done which is essentially operational and financial discipline, that is it. There is no strategic issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can argue we should have this, we should have that, but it doesn't matter really. What we have is enough. To the extent that I can help the company guide both operationally and financial discipline - on the financial discipline I rely immensely on my close colleague Krishna. And then I think it is quite straightforward the progress that we will deliver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now oil tends to both mask all of this and its impact facilitate all of this. It helps also, we can go much further much faster. It also masks to a degree the level of progress because it's such a horrific environment. But our shareholders or the financial markets should know that when it comes to us, we're not just fighting hard to adapt to a lower level of activity, we're transforming the company. And it is first and foremost an operational issue and the financial underpinnings are there to accelerate it and also measure it and keep it disciplined. But it is above all an operational issue. And it is - we're way advanced in it, far more than we would have hoped.\n",

    "\n",
    "James West\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard, I want to go back to the international markets where you talked about increasing market share as we go through 2016. And even with the market probably being down the 20% that Bill mentioned and we certainly agree with that, you would only be down about half of that. Is this market share gains that you've already achieved or contracts that are won? Or is this - and are in the bag? Or do need to win more contracts to achieve that type of result?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not in the bag, James, insofar as I wouldn't take any contracts that we bagged as being reliable. The point being that in a time of extreme strain it would be dishonest for me to tell you how well we booked it. The fact is that when we look at what we have it is essentially committed to, but I am taking a discount simply because I know that in this world and at this time clients can adjourn, they can postpone. And what is the oilfield service player going to do about it? Nothing, just wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the answer is there is some risk that we don't - that the assessment that we can hold back, if you will, the volume declines to about half what the market will be. There is some risk that we're not successful. I will point out to you that the place where we will play the hardest which is Eastern Hemisphere, so far - and we haven't really gotten our stride yet, we kept our own. In fact we have done more than keeping our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I will summarize by saying we have the business. It is not in my judgment reliable because it is not reliable for anybody in this environment. But we do have the business already. Let's assume we lose some, we will be have to paddle our canoe harder to gain some more; I think we can. Of all of the calibration we gave 2016, they are all sort of midpoint between conservative and more aggressive, this one is also the same. We actually have a more conservative view, but also a more aggressive view. This is really the reasonable midpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "James West\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, got it. And then if we switch over to North America where the decline has been and is probably going to be a lot worse, at least based on initial CapEx guidance from your customer base. You have the positives of the artificial - strength in artificial lifts but you have a little more exposure to Canada. How do you think you fare in the North American market versus your peer group?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "I think our - look, to the extent we're backing off, remember 20% of what we do is identified into our two product lines that we personally will only play if we can make a living which is pressure pumping and drilling tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the extent we deemphasize this, I would say that perhaps on the revenue side we won't fare so well because we may step back from these businesses - not entirely, but as the case may be more than anybody else. At this time I would say on the profitability standpoint we may actually fare better.\n",
    "\n",
    "So my suggestion is that as the Q1/Q2 sort of roll out going into Q3 which, as I mentioned, we - our [indiscernible] objective is to bring it into a breakeven quarter, we may very well in North America show - continue to show great resilience at the profitability level, but not so great revenue performance simply because deemphasizing [indiscernible] - as the other product lines do more than hold their own.\n",

    "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Angie Sedita\n",
    "\n",
    "So on the CapEx side and certainly I understand you are sitting on quite a bit of inventory. But as you slash CapEx in 2016 and 2015, are there business lines or regions that continue to be obviously your top priority? And then certain business lines or regions that you are a lower priority obviously in this type of market? And are there product lines or regions that you could exit and may be unlikely to return to in the coming near term years?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "I will say a few words and then, Krishna, you might want to come and also on this. This is a very good question, Angie; it is a bit difficult to answer it on a call. But we have - we have and we're going through a meticulous process. We're not doing it ourselves, it has been done by the field and the product line leadership. We're going through every single segment in which we play around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can imagine that with 12 different product service lines as we're organized and with the worldwide infrastructure we have there is lots and lots of questions to be asked. And we ask ourselves, could we do more? Should we stay? Should we do less? Should we pull in simple terms? We're doing this. And what are our metrics, financial metrics and also strategic as incline and reservoir metrics. They balance one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, we will pull out of certain country and regions on certain product lines and so forth. At the same time we will push much harder on others, not only for now because they - as little business as there is we can do better than we have. But also because of the potential longer term.\n",
    "\n",
    "There isn't an overriding theme though, Angie, as in we're pulling out of this, pulling out of that, no. I would say in general that overall it is fair to say that Eastern Hemisphere - overall there are differences in Eastern Hemisphere - we'll tend to fare better. I am not saying this - fare well but better than any other parts of what we have, although there are pockets that I see in America which will fare well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In North America we will become and have become a fortress of efficiency. So net-net we will pull out of certain involvement in certain countries, certain product lines, but there is an overriding theme. The core is the core. We like the core. We try to make it as profitable as we can for now and for long term, but the core hasn't changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Angie Sedita\n",
    "\n",
    "So the cost side, obviously transformation, as you have said for some period of time here, has been necessary. But when you think through your headcount as well as your non-labor portion of your cost base, how much of that do you see is structural and necessary and permanent and how much is cyclical which could return in 2017, 2018 and beyond?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna will answer that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Angie, we estimate that about one-third of the cost reductions right across 2014 and 2015 are structurally permanent. Because they have to do with de-layering the organization and working on the support structure with a lot of focus. So if you add the two years together, we had $1.4 billion of annualized savings in 2015, another $600,000 in 2014 which we did not talk about on the call. One-third of that is I would say permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "And when the recovery does happen we just have to constrain two things, we have to constrain the support cost, of course and keep the permanent reductions permanent, of course. And the second part is to constrain CapEx. And we believe our incrementals, both in earnings and in cash flow, free cash flow will be enormous [Technical Difficulty]. We're not even talking pricing here, we're just talking--\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it seems a bit academic for us to focus on the upside in a recovery. And we don't speculate, notwithstanding my comments on oil which probably were not terribly, terribly new. We don't speculate at all at any time in the market. We operate the company as if we're in a dismal environment for the very long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "We still also think though that is not going to be the case about structurally changing the economics of the company at a high level of operations. Clearly a strong recovery, if that was to happen, we would not be able to hold the indirects flat where they are today forever, but there would be a period of time and level of volume increase where we can and hence the strength of the incrementals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This 1/3rd of $2 billion is not just a Wall Street story. We've long given up on Wall Street stories. This is actually real. So $600 million to $700 million in our cost structure at Weatherford today are perennial. That means $0.60 to $0.70 per share, if you want to look at it that way, in a normalized manner in our cost structure have gone away in an up market, that is all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Angie Sedita\n",
    "\n",
    "And then one final quick one, you said that you gained some share on the artificial lift side in the international market. Is there a bigger push in this environment in the Eastern Hemisphere with artificial lift? And is there more to be gained on the market share in 2016? It looks like that is helping your margin there?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard Duroc-Danner\n",
    "\n",
    "I think actually, Angie, I would love to say yes. The reality is that lift, yes, but not any more than any completion probably is just as much and probably more - share gains. I think things that we very seldom talk about like liner hangers for example or cementation have share gains that are possible. Managed pressure drilling share gains are in an expansion of a type of technology which is not used very much. And I think in general formation evaluation has.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it sounds like it's almost everything, but it really depends where. But if I was going to say which one has the - of all of them has probably the strongest share gains in percentage and all that sort of stuff today, I would say completion probably more so than lift. Lift is fine, but one is actually likely to grow at a higher rate than the other.\n",

    "Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a brief recap of our operating performance in the first quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this was a disappointing quarter reflecting a sudden plunge in revenue across all regions, led by North American, while our aggressive cost reduction actions were not enough to stem the revenue drop, resulting in a sharp decline in operating margins. Loss per share for the quarter, before charges and credits, was $0.29. Revenue of $1.6 billion for the quarter decreased 21% sequentially and 43% year on year. The sequential decline was affected by a sharp decrease in the level of product sales as customers around the world cut back on product spending, which is partly seasonal after a strong Q4 and partly reflective of the new lower 2016 spending budget kicking in for these customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Product sales were down 30% sequentially, mainly in the U.S., Canada, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Latin American markets, with the Artificial Lift and Completion product lines declining the most. Excluding the decrease in product sales, service revenue was down 16% sequentially, in line with our peers. Operating income margins, before R&D and corporate expenses, declined by 943 basis points sequentially to negative 6.6%. Excluding the rigs business, our core business revenue decreased 21% sequentially with a 931 basis point deterioration in operating income margins to negative 5.4%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right though this long down cycle, we've been cutting costs and reducing our structure to cope with reduced activity and pricing pressures. This was evidenced by our 2015 decrementals versus 2014, which were best in class at 28%. While we continued to reduce costs in 2016, we have now reached the point in several operating locations around the world where any further reductions in structure or in cost will mean exiting the business in those locations. This means that we have reached a point where we will incur short-term operating losses by continuing operations at these locations. We have chosen to maintain this minimum cost structure, as the difficulty and the cost of rebooting and rebuilding our businesses when activity levels eventually increase far outweigh the short-term benefit of eliminating these businesses altogether. In all, we are carrying about $48 million in such costs, representing 300 basis points of margin and about $0.05 in earnings per share terms in our Q1 results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below operating margins, R&D costs reduced by $7 million, while corporate costs were down $4 million, reflecting spending cuts in line with the reduced budgets for this year. The tax benefit recorded in the first quarter reflected the tax benefit on the losses in the U.S. primarily, which are recoverable, partly offset by tax provisions internationally. The tax rate for 2016 will be dependent on the geographical mix of earnings and will be heavily weighted by results in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excluding the rigs business, sequential decrementals were 38% on a 21% revenue drop, and year-over-year decrementals were reasonable at 27% on a 44% revenue decrease. Adjusting operating income for R&D and corporate expenses, our sequential decrementals improved to 35%, while the year-over-year decrementals improved to 24%. We expect to hold sequential decrementals in the low 30s going forward, while the year-over-year decrementals should hold in the mid-20s. Bernard will comment in more detail on the operating results and the outlook later in the call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming to net debt and cash flow now, net debt reduced by $373 million to reach $6.6 billion at March 31. This reflects mainly the net proceeds from the equity offering of $630 million, partly offset by consumption of $216 million in operations this quarter. The negative free cash flow performance, while disappointing, was significantly better than the $266 million free cash flow consumption of Q1 in 2015, despite recording much steeper losses this year. All our larger peers recorded negative free cash flow in the first quarter this year. However, we were the only ones to improve versus Q1 of last year on the free cash flow metric. Excluding the cash flow consumption of $47 million on the Zubair contract in Iraq, $71 million of severance and restructuring cash costs, and $50 million of out-of-period interest payments, free cash flow was a negative $48 million for the quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working capital balances reduced by $119 million, reflecting strong customer collections and inventory reductions. CapEx was well-controlled and was low at $43 million. As of March 31, available liquidity was $1.4 billion. The debt-to-cap calculation came in at 53.6%, versus the 70% covenant, meaning there was significant headroom against the covenant.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would now like to update our free cash flow forecast of the year. Primarily due to the large unexpected losses in Q1 and the continuing trough into Q2, we now revise our full-year free cash flow forecast to be between $400 million and $500 million. This downward revision by $200 million versus our previous forecast takes into account three parameters: lower earnings by $350 million, partly offset by lower working capital, principally receivables, by $100 million, and lower CapEx by $50 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Losses for the year will be higher, reflecting the unexpected sharp drop in activity and pricing levels in Q1, which is expected to persist into Q2. With lower revenue, receivables will generate additional liquidity of $100 million. And given the low spend in Q1, a $250 million CapEx revised target for the year should not be difficult to achieve, particularly with the low start to the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent with the previous forecast, this new forecast assumes that we will strike an out-of-court settlement agreement on change orders with our customer on the Zubair EPF contract in Iraq. If we are not successful in reaching a satisfactory settlement, we will take the matter to an international arbitration panel. And while the cash settlement in this scenario could well be delayed into 2017, we believe the settlement through an arbitration process would be for a significantly larger amount. Such a turn of events could reduce this year's free cash flow forecast by an additional $150 million to $200 million. Discussions with our client are ongoing. The progress on the Zubair project has been very good, with only three final milestones remaining out of 18 to be achieved. We expect these milestones to be achieved by the end of May.\n",
    "\n",
    "We successfully repaid the bond of $350 million that matured in February 2016, as well as certain other short-term facilities totaling $150 million. With this revised free cash flow forecast, we expect net debt levels to reduce to below $6 billion by the end of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to the new credit facility now. Given the environment we are in and the extreme pressure banks are facing with their exposure to the energy, principally E&P, industry, with significant loan loss provisions being recorded by almost every bank, this was not the ideal time to negotiate a revolver for a non-investment grade name like ours. However, as our current revolver was due to expire in July 2017, we had no choice but to renegotiate this facility before it went current. After over two months of difficult discussions and an extremely thorough examination by our banks, I am pleased to announce that we have successfully negotiated new financing agreements, which will be effective from next week, and replace the current facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key features of this new financing facility. Firstly, it includes a secure term loan of $500 million. This term loan matures in July 2020. Next, it includes an unsecured revolver of $1.151 billion, expiring in July 2019. Both of these new facilities are enhanced by appropriate upstream subsidiary guarantees. A residual revolver totaling $229 million, expiring in July next year, covering banks that declined to extend the current facility, is also available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 17 banks in our previous facility, 15 of them agreed to extend their cover, with only four of the 15 reducing their commitment slightly. Two banks declined to participate in the extension, but their current commitments will stay in place until July 2017. This demonstrates the strong relationship we have with the majority of our banking group who share our common view of the future. The term loan will amortize down 10% annually, while the revolver will amortize down by 5% in the first year and then by 10% annually after that, but will not reduce below $1 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have the following covenants to adhere to during the life of the facilities. Firstly, a specified debt-to-EBITDA ratio of below 3.0 times until the end of 2016, and then below 2.5 times after that. As of March 31, on a backtest, we are at 1.1 times versus the 3.0 times, meaning there's plenty of headroom. For covenant purposes, specified debt is defined as the debt enhanced by subsidiary guarantees and represents only the drawn amounts against the facilities, while the EBITDA is defined to exclude all non-cash charges, such as impairments and write-offs of assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we have a covenant which is defined as follows: a specified debt plus letters of credit – that means the sum total of the two – to EBITDA ratio of below 4.0 times until the end of 2016, and then below 3.5 times after that. The only difference from the previous covenant is the addition of outstanding letters of credit or guarantees to the level of specified debt, and a higher ratio by one turn to accommodate these LCs. As of March 31, on a backtest, we are at 1.7 times versus the requirement of 4 times, meaning, again, there's plenty of headroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also a third covenant, which is specified assets to specified debt – we must maintain a ratio of at least 4 times. As of March 31, this ratio is at 14 times, meaning, again, there's substantial headroom on the third covenant. Based on our forecast over the life of the facility, we expect to retain and in fact improve the headroom versus these three covenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we negotiated these covenants at a time when the industry is at a trough, we were able to secure extremely accommodating covenants which have almost no danger of breach during the life of the facilities. We also ran a stressed model, assuming a flat $40 oil price until the end of 2018. This model results in flat revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow in 2017 and 2018 at 2016 levels or slightly lower. Even under such a draconian set of assumptions, we retain significant headroom versus these three negotiated covenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the debt-to-cap covenant that existed up until now has been discarded and is not valid anymore. Just to be clear, we will have a $1.88 billion facility starting next week, down from $2 billion. This facility will reduce to $1.54 billion after amortization in July 2017; then it'll reduce down to $1.4 billion as of July 2018, and so on. Such a reduction should not be viewed as constraining to Weatherford. As a matter of fact, the total actual drawdown against the facilities for the last several quarters have been as follows: $1.04 billion as of 30th September last year; $967 million as of last year-end, and now $1.04 billion as of the end of the first quarter this year, which are far below any of these levels that I mentioned. At its lowest point of availability, which is $1.4 billion as of July 2018, we still have sufficient headroom when recent utilization levels of approximately $1 billion are taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, we also maintain roughly $500 million of cash balances on an ongoing basis. So, when you net that off against the outstanding revolver, you've got to reduce $500 million of cash is roughly fungible. I would like to also remind you that off a total gross debt of $7.1 billion at March 31, only the revolver drawdown of $1.04 billion has any financial covenants attached to it. The remaining debt, comprising mainly long-term bonds, which is over 80% of our total debt, do not carry any ratio-driven covenants, nor do they carry any credit rating triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to conclude my prepared remarks by addressing our plan to manage the upcoming bond maturities over the next several years. The total value of bond maturities from 2017 through to 2020 is $2.9 billion. Here is how we plan to finance the repayment of these bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, free cash flow is expected to be in the $400 million to $500 million range this year, as I explained previously. Add to that a range of $600 million to $750 million annually of free cash flow for each of the next four years, and you get a total of $2.4 billion to $3 billion. These cash flows assume a recovering and strengthening oilfield services market resulting in improved margins – improving margins but solid incrementals, given the reduction on a fixed cost base. And despite investment in working capital to fuel the growth, CapEx will continue to be muted as our excess capacity gets fully utilized, delaying significant growth CapEx spending into 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we expect to divest the land rigs business over the next three years, when industry conditions and valuations get better. Our current estimate is that the cash component of such a transaction would be between $500 million and $1 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will opportunistically tap the public debt markets to refinance some of these bond maturities, and over the next four years, we believe debt markets will be open to us. In reality, we believe there is a high-yield market open to us even today.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, a combination of free cash flow, proceeds from asset sales, and potential new debt issuances will allow us to comfortably manage the upcoming debt maturities. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bernard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, Krishna. And good morning, everyone. Few comments on Q1 results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, Q1 is always our worst quarter. This year's the same. The four key numbers are revenue declined 21% sequentially, 43% year on year; decrementals of 38% sequentially and 28% year on year; free cash flow was $216 million use of cash, $50 million better than Q1 2015, and that without any consideration for large severance cash payments and final cash outlay for the Zubair. Free cash flow doesn't matter for our peers as it does for us, given balance sheet differentials. It is worth observing Weatherford's free cash flow numbers as is, inclusive of all, we're the best – or the least bad, if you will – in class year-on-year performers of our peer group. This isn't an accident: The company has, at all levels of operations, an ingrained focus on cash flow here and now and perennially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking down Q1 revenues into its main components, product sales dropped by over 30%, service revenues by 16%, and rigs by 19%. This added up to a sequential 21% drop. Product sales usually drop sequentially in Q1, and this year was no exception. The overwhelming majority of the drop was seasonal and particularly affected the Eastern Hemisphere. Product sales for Weatherford are Well Construction, except TRS and Managed Pressure Drilling, Completion, and Lift. Service revenues are Tubular Running Services, MPD, and Formation Evaluation. Taken together, the proportion of product sales to the total revenues is on average about 40%, with large quarter-to-quarter variations. Product sales will improve in Q2 seasonally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regionally, the quarter was difficult in every corner of the world. Both the U.S. and Canada were very challenged. Canada's Q1 was the lowest in company's recorded history for first quarter, normally that region's strongest seasonal peak. Q1 was in fact lower than Q2 of last year, during a then already very depressed breakup. It's quite unimaginable, the activity crash. The U.S. was just as bad, but no worse than Canada, thanks to tremendous effort around sales, operational execution, and extreme cost management. Much of our market performance was exemplary, except for two service lines, which have consistently handicapped our U.S. operations: pressure pumping and rentals. No surprise there. With 30% of U.S. revenues in Q1 being counted for 76% of the losses, those numbers say it all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenues for NAM declined by 22%, and decrementals were a more severe 39%. Year-on-year decrementals were held at 19%, a 53% revenue decline, which was excellent cost management in the midst of a collapsing volume and pricing environment. For the first time in 15 months, we held back on further organizational cost action in NAM beyond what was planned. By March, with only a few exceptions, we decided not to curtail employee counts or basin presence any further. We decided to keep some measure of staffing in place in U.S. and Canada on furlough, waiting on market direction beyond Q2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latin America held better than NAM, albeit it was also very strained. Revenues declined by 18% sequentially, decrementals were held at 18% also at a very decent 30% year on year by aggressive cost control. All country operations declined except Argentina. Colombia, traditionally one of our largest Latin American operations, was eviscerated. Brazil and Mexico weakened further. We had already seriously curtailed Venezuela last year, so the operational minimum necessary fell onto our nucleus organization and infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eastern Hemisphere experienced a severe seasonal in addition to cyclical downturn in activity. As highlighted earlier, our product sales were very low in the quarter, representing much of the company's overall product sales drop. That drove 22% lower revenues and 45% decrementals sequentially – high for us because product sales typically carry higher margins. Cost reductions could not help as much as they will; they lagged North America for local regulatory reasons by about two quarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the European, Caspian, Russian, SSA region, revenue was down 24%, reflecting sharp seasonal winter declines in Russia and North Sea, coupled with project cancellations across SSA. SSA margin has dipped ever so slightly into negative territory, as costs could not make up for activity reduction fast enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenues in Middle East and Asia Pacific region decreased by 20%, with margins dropping to just under 2%, with sharp seasonal declines across several parts of the Asia Pacific region. MENA showed resilience, but much was offset by a combination of very low part sales in the quarter and the full effect of pricing concessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the rig operations, as expected, had a difficult quarter. It was a transitional quarter; as we moved rigs into new markets, we mobilized on new contracts. On the cost side, we announced earlier this year an additional reduction in force of 6,000. As of the end of April, almost 6,000, or 5,874 employees, had already left the payroll, substantially completing the program. We extended the program to cover another 2,000 reduction in force, bringing it to 8,000, if you will, which we expect to complete by the end of Q2. Annualized savings already crystallized from actions to date are specifically $408 million, with savings impacting Q1 to the tune of $34 million. So the bulk of it is coming in Q2, et cetera. The next two quarters will show much higher levels of savings from the actions to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the cash cost of the severance program was heavy in Q1, heavier than we expected. There will be lower severance cash payouts in Q2 as a corollary. We had also announced the closure of nine manufacturing facilities this year. Of this, four were shut in Q1 alone. In addition, 26 operating and service facilities were shut down in North America during the quarter. All this added to a difficult but productive quarter, which was expected, and also we believe will set the trough for the year in this cyclical depression, which brings me to the outlook for Q2.\n",
    "\n",
    "NAM results will be weaker in Q2. Revenues will decline Q1 on Q2, similarly to Q4 and Q1. The depth and breadth of cost cuts achieved will improve the decrementals versus Q1, but the region's operating income will decline further. We believe Q2, though, will be the trough for Weatherford's NAM. Latin America will also be weaker in Q2, but substantially less than now in terms of decline. Q2 will look similar to Q1 and will likely have single-digit lower revenues and operating income, no worse. We also believe Q2 will be the trough for Weatherford Latin America.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eastern Hemisphere in Q2 will be up modestly Q1 on Q2, revenues and, more significantly, operating income. The increase in revenues is one factor; the different mix with a return of product sales is the other factor, probably a larger factor, together with a much lower cost basis. The cost cuts have a lag, remember, and they will benefit Eastern Hemisphere starting from Q2. This brings us to the following assessment: We believe Q1 will have been the trough for Weatherford's Eastern Hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the rig operation will improve gradually its profitability in Q2, and there on. Because of the mobilization, Q1 will have been the trough also for our rig operation. Now, I do realize our assessment of both Latin America and even more so Eastern Hemisphere for Q2 is at a variance to our larger peers. Remember, although we overlap and compete in Formation Evaluation and Completion, by and large we do not in what we call Well Construction and Lift. In Well Construction and Lift, we are more complementary than competitive and have, at times, a somewhat different prognosis timewise for performance. Adding the pieces together, our view is that Q2 will net out at a similar net income to Q1 with a worse NAM but a better international.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Q2, we'll have concluded the bulk of our two-year massive cost restructuring, leaving behind only supply chain work underway. The change in efficiency and cost structure make a very large and structural difference. We also believe there will be seasonal and some early signs, however modest, of cyclical market improvements in Q3 and Q4. Profitability in the second half 2016 will be improved over the first half.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're preparing cautiously, but with determination, for the beginnings of a possible recovery. The decision to opt for a furlough program in North America, rather than more organizational shrinkage, is a clear example of such. The turn will come and will come early for us. Weatherford is more development than production and exploration. We are more land than offshore. We're best-positioned to benefit from the first turn in the market. Two examples, In NAM, our Completion and Lift portfolios are directly applicable to the gradual completions of the drilled but uncompleted wells. Second, the massive destocking of client inventories for rod lift and PCP lift equipment will be the first drivers of a turn. That's for NAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internationally, Russia and pockets of Latin America will be the first movers, while our Middle East region will accelerate its rebuilding through the second half of the year. Again, we remain very cautious, but we are building our own conviction that second half 2016 will be better for Weatherford and the beginning of a long-term turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiteration of 2016 priorities. At the time of this call, we have successfully achieved banking commitments for our credit line through July 2019 to replace existing lines. Successful equity offering of last March also provided additional liquidity. Both capital formation events are clear positives and place us on safe ground. They do not change our free cash flow objectives. Free cash flow generation has ingrained the company's long-term direction. We have total organizational buy-in, specific incentives, and disciplined metrics on free cash flow objectives. With the end of the RIF or the reduction in force severance, and the Zubair financing, our free cash flow performance the balance of the year will be strong and reliable. We'll build on our operating progress today with more efficiency, cash discipline, and systematic talent upgrades and selective market share focus. We'll delever the balance sheet through free cash flow each and every year and eventually with more asset sales when achievable. This is our direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our cost of organizational actions to date centered around improving five things and doing so in a perennial way. One, lower cost structure through cycles. Out of an estimated annualized to date $2.5 billion of cost reductions realized since 2014, we know specifically that over $1 billion are permanent or structural. This means Weatherford will have close to $1.00 a share of incremental earnings and cash flow above our prior earnings peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two, capital allocation and cash generation is a company-wide discipline. This is ingrained in our culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three, leapfrog talent bench and talent development as a culture. We have upgraded our talent systematically from field to senior management. We've made talent development into an organizational priority. We never had operationally and financially as talented and deep of a bench as we have today. We may be smaller; we are much better managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four, focus on quality and reliability for all product lines. Quality and reliability and execution everywhere, all the time, are a strategic priority. I specifically commented on these internal objectives and priority in my recent comments at the opening ceremony of the ATSE conference in Dehradun. Quality and reliability is our most important metric of operational achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Five, technological innovation, both incremental and step change channels, strictly on our core. So buttressing our leadership where we lead and gaining leadership where we don't. During OTC which is happening now, we have hosted a three-day technology exhibition at one of our R&D centers in Houston. We had more client attendance by far than we ever experienced. We cannot afford to be technological leaders or co-leaders on all product and service lines. We can and will on our core.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the massive cost containments come to an end, I will summarize the cost accomplishments from the first days of 2015. We believe we did more and further than anyone else. Reduction in force, for a total employee count on January 1, 2015, of 55,318. We ended Q1 2016 at 34,808. We expect a trough of total head count at about 32,000 shortly after Q2, will have been (33:26) a 42% total company payroll reduction in 18 months. This is a clean cost restructuring without any divestment to assist the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We took down our support ratio – which is indirects to directs or support to directs, if you will – from 59% in 2014 to where it presently stands at 38.6%. A 20% (sic) [20 percentage point] (33:49) decline in support ratio is a colossal structural change in record time. To do this in a cyclical downturn is very difficult. [ph] It is also (33:59) structural change will provide us with outsized incremental margins through the recovery years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations were streamlined with consolidation of our geographic segments, flattening of the reporting organization, scaling down regional headquarters, and push the country closer to the sand face. (34:12) Supply chain is the midst of a two-year restructuring and productivity leapfrog. Manufacturing, logistics, and procurement are implementing fundamental productivity and efficiency change. This is an economic breakthrough for our operating cost structure flexibility of adjustment to changes in business volumes. Of all the ongoing cost initiatives, this one alone will carry forward through 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the above describes what we accomplished taking advantage of extremely depressed market conditions. The operating decisions will now be adjusted. We're calling for an end to our reduction in force drive and organizational compression. The last remnants of the layoffs will occur in Q2, but beyond, we'll arrest the direct cost drive and prepare cautiously, but prepare nonetheless, for a turn in our markets. Only the vast supply chain reorganization work will continue until full completion. Weatherford is well advanced in its fundamental transformation. From cost structure, cooperating practices, and quality focus, returns objective, and a culture of sales, we are a completely different company in the making. Our performance in the recovery to come will surprise to the upside.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a few comments on macro, but I'll keep them to a minimum. We have long said that after a lag, decline rates would accelerate, that the effects were underestimated and the industry was producing at near capacity, which is something none of us have ever experienced. We'll also add in that the industry will not be able to manage required oil demand as early as 2017. This means oil demand would not be met by existing oil capacity. Inventory overhang will help, but by definition it isn't more than a stopgap solution. We more than ever believe all the above is correct. Other than a few barrels coming from Iran, in theory one day from Libya, by our assessment the industry has little spare capacity beyond the present operating rates. Project announcements to the contrary, we believe this to be accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, elasticity of supply response to higher oil prices are being ignored or overstated. In my 30 years in the oilfield and my prior years watching my father operate in same, I have never seen anything like it. The full return cost of developing existing bases around the world, including the U.S. tight oil reservoirs, will not work financially unless oil pricing and related financing change and change fast to a materially different level. This is how we see our industry situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, regardless of the macro outcome, we're making Weatherford focused, operationally very strong, disciplined, and returns-driven. We'll never go down the same path to excessive leverage ever again. We have fundamentally changed our cost structure, quality, efficiency, returns culture, and emphatically our talent bench. This is today a very different company. We'll maintain strong free cash flow and liquidity. We dedicate our every effort to delever the balance sheet and do so permanently. We are positioning Weatherford with selected markets and clients, using our product line strengths and specific technological leadership. In this time of great transactional turbulence in our industry, we have remained an island of calm and internal efficiency focus. Our operating and management capabilities are immeasurably stronger than they historically were.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we have a worldwide infrastructure of service support, second to none. Except for a few marginal locations internationally, we have kept the international infrastructure intact. We are confident of our technological strength, product line breadth, and market potential for organic growth. Our numbers will prove out the merits of our direction in this brutal down cycle and even more so when the market turns. We believe this is what will deliver the highest shareholder returns at the lowest risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, I'll return the call to the operator for Q&A.\n",

So can you discuss that with a little bit more detail? Because you talked about revising the free cash flow forecast down to $400 million, but in the event that Zubair doesn't swing your way, that could be too high by a couple hundred million dollars, if I understood you correctly. So can you shed some light on that, please?\n",

That settlement is being discussed right now, and we have not reached a point where we can mutually agree to the settlement. If we don't reach a settlement, we will not get any more cash, even against the milestone payments that are due to us contractually, because we believe our customer will withhold all cash going forward. If that happens, then about $150 million to $200 million of cash that could otherwise have come to us, including the settlement estimate, will not come to us anymore. So which means basically the $450 million of free cash flow will then reduce by $150 million, $200 million, right? That's what I was talking about. Now, in fact, we're getting closer to a settlement agreement with our customer, and if we maybe, if everything works out, be able to announce a settlement in the next several weeks. If that happens then the $450 million remains intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\n",
    "\n",
    "So you believe it is likely you will reach a favorable settlement on this front?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n",
    "\n",
    "I think both sides are not too far apart right now, and so I think it is – I would give it more than 50% chance that we will reach a settlement, yes...\n",
    "\n",
    "William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\n",
    "\n",
    "And so what exactly – yeah, what exactly is being disputed here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a level of compensation for the change orders. We have a number of change orders that we have documented over the last three years, which are changes to the original design of the facility that was in the tender, and none of those change orders have been compensated for. So we have a certain claim, and that claim has not been honored or recognized by our customer. So that's basically the subject matter of the discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. Switching gears for a second from the balance sheet. Bernard, in the event that international revenues as a whole continue to bleed lower over the course of the year, what then is the likely roadmap for margins, given the interplay between pricing concessions on the one hand and those continuing to roll through and on the other hand the more aggressive cost-cutting that you continue to implement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, just to put things in perspective, as I mentioned, a lot of the cost cuts have not impacted much yet, but they will following Q2, the international operations. And more specifically, the Eastern Hemisphere, which takes the longest from a regulatory standpoint to be able to absorb the layoffs and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have approximately – going through all the cost cuts through Q1 – we have approximately $100 million a quarter more of cost cuts that are going to come through the Eastern Hemisphere and also Latin America. But that is actually – but a lot of it is going to come through the Eastern Hemisphere. That is quite a cushion on further erosion coming from volumes and pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing also, Bill, is that when we talk about product sales, that is one we have some visibility on. We have a notion of what is going to be delivered or expected to be delivered in a number of different products, and that gives us also a sense of volume and margins to come. The services more, I think – I think are vulnerable in the event the project gets further canceled and so forth. Respect to pricing, we also have in a sense what was given. In our particular case, pricing concessions have been given. There is no significant amounts of other pricing concessions being negotiated for us. I'll also point out to you that there are very large tender activities which are ongoing which have been very recent, which suggests that many of our clients all the sudden are very interested in locking in volumes at current pricing, which suggests also that volume is unlikely to go down further, more likely to inch up some.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this would tell you that the cost reductions are sizable, the product line deliveries are relatively predictable, pricing concessions we have already, quite a bit, have gone through Q4 and Q1 here now. There isn't much that we know of analytically to go through incrementally in Q2. All of this to say that the road map for international in Q2, Q3, Q4, should be, depending on your viewpoint on the macro, either constructive or better than constructive in our particular case.\n",
    "\n",
    "William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. Thank you very much.\n",

    "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks a lot, and thanks for a SRO rundown here or how you see the world. So just to clarify, you say that a similar quarter in the second quarter to what you delivered in the first quarter – do you mean at the EPS level or at the normalized level, the EBITDA level?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Well, actually, the EBITDA and the EPS level. The EBITDA may be a little bit higher, but not materially. But net-net at the net income level, the EPS level, similar, made up of deteriorating North America further, if it was possible. Latin America a little bit lower, and Eastern Hemisphere a little bit higher on the top line, but operating income the biggest moving part for us. Simply because of product mix in Q2 versus Q1. You add the pieces together, it suggests to us that we would have Q1 or Q2 flat at the earnings level. Albeit, the revenues may come down some when all these are added up together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n",
    "\n",
    "And if I think about the normalized free cash flow loss in the first quarter as $50 million, and if it excludes Zubair on the second quarter, what would a reasonable range be to bracket the second quarter free cash flow, excluding Zubair?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah. Let's put Zubair on the side because it is a one-time event. And so, for clarity's sake, without Zubair, our free cash flow in Q2 should be $100 million to $125 million – something like that – excluding Zubair. That's net of whatever severance would be still occurring, which would be less than in Q1, but some still.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n",
    "\n",
    "Understood. And just finally, at your macro statement you highlighted the declines. Is it anything particularly that you see around the world which makes you more confident that we are closer to this inflection point in any particular region, or anything else that you see?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say that one of the benefits of having a fabulous team around me at Weatherford today is I tend to have more time to do what I think might be useful at this juncture. And what is more useful I think at this juncture is try to interact as much as I can with the client base. And that's a long-term process.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does that have to do with your question? I have, then, a multiplicity of verbal, qualitative, but meaningful nonetheless, data points from the Continental Europe, from Russia, from Latin America, from pockets of the Middle East. And I know full well what's going on in the deepwater plays, which are longer to have an effect – so ignoring the latter, just all the commentary on the particular regions I'm describing, I add them together – it doesn't take a great modeling capability to see a frightening amount of volume being lost permanently. And it doesn't have to be spectacular individually – 100,000, 150,000 being lost over a period of a few quarters and accelerating, but you add them all together and the picture is – for us actually is, as much as we recompute our numbers all the time, because we have a hard time believing it, the picture is one of a shrinking supply base, which we do not see any available capacity, which is there to be able to replace it. Certainly not on call, and I mean on call within a year or two. It's qualitative but it's multifaceted. Many, many client interactions, particularly in more relaxed atmosphere after meetings take place.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah, so that's part of the settlement discussion. So we don't know where that's going to end up. But assuming that no settlement takes place at all, right, and we go to arbitration, then, yes, we will have a cash outflow in April and May.\n",
    "\n",
    "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n",

    "Well, I understand getting paid back for change orders; I'm just trying to figure out how much the operating loss – cash loss would be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah. They're intertwined. So operating cash loss was about $10 million to $15 million a month, and we will have two months of operations -\n",

    "There are several of us who are looking forward to Zubair being over almost as much as you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not possible. It's not possible...\n",
    "\n",
    "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost. Almost. You'd be amazed. CapEx, you've dropped CapEx by 80%-plus since 2014. I understand there's overcapacity. Your rental business is not doing fabulous, and that's, I guess, historically been a big eater of CapEx. How much do you jeopardize the future? How much are you going to have to ramp up in 2019? I mean, are we sacrificing -?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah. I'll give the beginning of an answer, and then Krishna will do the second half. If you take CapEx and you break it down into three different places of application – so you talk about the infrastructure, which is all the bases around the world, you talk about supply chain, and you talk about the tools, the service tools – generally, service tool being applicable to whether it's a completion service tool, whether it's an LWD kit, et cetera, okay? I would have to say that the supply chain as it now stands can accommodate easily, easily three times the volume we have. And that's actually almost a silly statement because we have no – we have plenty of machining and roof line and so forth. So we're rationalizing it right now. It is not a source of CapEx requirement until and unless the industry is materially different. And I'm talking a level of volume that you do not expect anytime soon, talking about years. So that one is just not a consumer CapEx.\n",
    "\n",
    "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we get into the infrastructure. We rationalize North America. We did take down a number of facilities, not too many internationally. We now have in 85 countries by my latest count, the sort of base representation we feel is desirable, given our long-term presence, et cetera. And I would have to say that the infrastructure can accommodate more than two times the volume that we are running through the company today, easily. That, again, is not an area of CapEx. I will remind you that we built this infrastructure ourselves. It was a big user of CapEx in years past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you get to the tool side, the service tool side. Well, we do have – take a look at our inventory, take a look at our PP&E. Depending on what kind of tool, it will be in one or the other category. By our assessment also, we have largely available somewhere between – tool components that can accommodate 50% to twice the size of volume we have. Right. That's a lot of numbers that suggest we're not starving the business. We're very careful how we do it. We're not sort of holding our breath waiting for better times. We have far more PP&E and equipment capabilities than people realize, which is, in a way, sanctioning an overspending of the past, which none of can be proud of, least of all myself. But it is an assessment today. You should not presume we're starving. Do you want to add, Krishna, to that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I think that then when you look at 2017 and 2018, we can certainly spend very low levels of CapEx while still maintaining a healthy growth potential. And then from 2019 onwards I would suggest that as a percentage of revenue we will stay at between 5% to 6% of revenue for the next two or three years. So this is quite low compared to historical levels, but it's well-explained by Bernard. We have plenty of capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. And my follow-up, if I could, Latin America, what and where gets better first?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a good question. I would say that my guess – it's a guess – is Colombia primarily, because it's so devastated and it's heavily a land market, you know that. And although it's (53:44) heavily a land market, it's so eviscerated, they don't have the kind of political upheaval you have here in Brazil. Argentina has remained healthy. I can't imagine Venezuela because they are so financially, let's say strained. That leaves Mexico. But Mexico is still going through a lot of the restructuring of the industry and so forth and so on. So by process of elimination I have to say Colombia is your best bet.\n",

    "Your next question comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie of IBERIA Capital. Your line is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks, guys. Bernard, a couple questions for you, if I may. First, are you guys seeing any signs of pickup, say, in the U.S. in any kind of completions or workover activity for you guys? And, secondly, as part of your conversations with your customers that you talked about earlier, how have those changed, if you will, over the past week, two weeks, month, two months? Are we seeing a turn in sentiment there?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. On the first one, I'm sorry to say, that, no, there isn't any signs of a pickup or anything else like that as of today in the U.S. – i.e., I think the U.S., it's really a question of cash flow for our clients. And that's price of oil, and it's also financing capabilities. This is one thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is interesting question. It's very simple. I'm getting a lot of questions on what I am seeing in terms of production rate difficulties with other reservoirs and other plays from particular clients wanting to know how the other ones are doing, what do I see in terms of trends. It's sort of interesting that they want to compare their own difficulties on and around decline rates with other difficulties, not so much for competitive reasons, but to get a sense what is happening to the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's been a real lot – these are informal conversations. They are outside of the realm of formal meetings which take place also with clients. And I think, for me, are far more valuable than the formal aspects. So it's a lot of conversations, systematically, really, from what am I seeing in other parts of the world. One of the advantages of being an oilfield service person, from an oil and gas perspective, is you get to see lots of reservoirs and lots of reservoir situations, actually more so than the people exploiting it, who are constrained or restricted to the ones they're developing. You have a rich sort of pool of information as, if you will, a traveling salesman, as it were.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC\n",
    "\n",
    "Great. Thank you. But in terms of what they're indicating to you – I understand that they're pumping you for information, but what are they indicating to you, if anything, about how their plans are evolving?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "They are sort of – in general, they have no authority or capital or plans for additional drilling, and they're trying to hold off decline rates. And they are, in many cases, it's coming to the point where they cannot do that anymore and so it creates a lot of strain and worries, and they're quite anxious to know where and when cash flow will allow them to restart activity, because they're very afraid of losing production rather rapidly now. There is an acceleration. You hold it off and ultimately there is acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC\n",
    "\n",
    "Great...\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "So there's really a sense of – we're at the point now where they are afraid of declines that they cannot hold off, hence their interest in understanding where and when the industry could have a turn because they're sort of worried about their own production profile, given the fact they're running out of – through intervention and the sorts of things you can do with a limited budget, very, very scarce drilling, they're worried about being able to hold off the decline rates where they are without them accelerating further.\n",

    "Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a recap of our operating performance in the second quarter. Overall, our revenue of $1.4 billion declined 11% or by $183 million, sequentially. While our operating income, before R&D and corporate expenses, reduced only marginally by $11 million, reflecting the beneficial impact of the large cost reduction actions taken this year. Sequential operating income margins deteriorated by 168 basis points to reach negative 8.3%. Sequential decrementals were excellent at 6%. Loss per share for the quarter, before charges and credits, was $0.28, which was $0.01 better than the first quarter, while EBITDA was flat with the first quarter at $58 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "North America revenue declined 26%, outperforming a 35% reduction in average rig count and continued pricing headwinds. Seasonal activity reductions, due to the spring break-up in Canada, coupled with pressure pumping activity hitting new lows with two fewer crews operating at the end of the quarter, compared to the start of the quarter. Having said that, operating losses reduced substantially by $27 million with the aggressive cost actions taken this year resulting in Brazilian margins, albeit negative, of minus 25.2% and sequential incrementals of 19%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internationally, our revenue declined 3% on a sequential rig count reduction of 7%. Latin America bore the brunt of the decline with sequential revenue dropping 18%, due to steep customer spending cuts in Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating income margins also fell sharply as cost reduction actions that were taken late in the quarter, while benefiting future quarters, were not enough to mitigate the drop in revenue. Operating income margins dropped to just 1%, but with the recent cost actions, this should improve going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eastern Hemisphere revenue increased by 4% sequentially. In the Europe/Caspian/Russia/Sub-Sahara Africa region, sharp activity reductions in offshore West Africa were only partly mitigated by a seasonal recovery in Russia resulting in a sequential revenue reduction of 5% while operating margins improved to make the region profitable again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Middle East/North Africa/Asia Pacific region, the sequential revenue increase of 11% reflected the final contract settlement of the Zubair project and higher activity in Algeria more than offsetting declines across several Asia Pacific operations. Operating income margins declined 180 basis points to essentially a break-even level, reflecting the full impact of pricing concessions given to customers in prior quarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenue for the Land Rigs business declined 9%, with lower sequential utilization rates. However, strong cost reduction actions, which are structural and enduring in nature, allowed us to improve the operating income by $9 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the cost side, as of last week, we have completed 97% of the previously announced reduction in force exercise of 8,000. This means that we have reduced our total payroll by 42% over the last 18 months since the 1st of January 2015. Given the current market context and the anticipated increase in activity levels, we have chosen to preserve capability to address the upcoming growth, which are in excess of the requirements of current activity levels. Such additional costs included in our quarterly results amount to $50 million, representing 350 basis points of margin and $0.05 in EPS terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to be clear on the cost reduction front. Should the industry environment abruptly change back to February levels and persist at those levels, we can eliminate this additional annualized retained cost of $200 million and, furthermore, collapse our operating structure materially to save even more costs. Such steps would be extreme and would impair our capability to grow in the future without additional investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below operating margins, R&D costs reduced by $5 million sequentially, while corporate costs were down $8 million, reflecting spending cuts in line with the reduced budgets. These levels are sustainable going forward. The tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 21% reflected the tax benefit on the losses, primarily in the U.S., partly offset by tax provisions internationally. The tax rate for 2016 will be dependent on the geographical mix of earnings and will be heavily weighted by results in the U.S. but could swing widely as a percentage rate as the levels of income are quite low. The second quarter results also included net after-tax charges of $312 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me go through the key charges. We took a charge of $101 million in litigation charges, mainly related to advancement in negotiations with the SEC regarding our income tax restatements from previous years. A charge of $84 million was taken to reflect the fair market value adjustment of a note receivable from a customer in Venezuela. While we intend to hold this note to maturity and collect on the entire face value and the associated interest, accounting rules mandate the write-down on this note to reflect its current market value. Over time, this value should continue to increase as commodity prices recover and maturity dates get nearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We took a charge of $69 million from bond tender premiums that were paid related to the repurchase of our senior notes; a charge of $62 million, primarily from write-downs in inventory and other assets as we continue to resize the business; a charge of $41 million in severance and restructuring charges; and finally, a credit of $45 million of income relating to the Zubair legacy contract, reflecting the favorable terms of settlement reached with that customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that, as of this print, the construction phase of this contract has been completed and is now in the routine operations and maintenance phase where we hand over the project to our customer while training them to operate the facilities. So it's quite routine now. So from now onwards, you will never again hear us talking about the Zubair contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to the near-term outlook. We expect a modest recovery in activity levels in the U.S., which has already seen a 7% quarter-to-date increase in rig count on land, augmented by the post-break-up seasonal recovery in Canada. Signs of increasing activity are already manifesting in the U.S., with two additional pressure pumping crews being deployed in July. In fact, we made 77 job offers last week to manage the staffing of these crews.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes about three weeks currently to re-equip our stock fleet with minimal CapEx, but it takes up to six weeks to re-staff the fleet crew. Already, there are signs of a tightening labor market in the U.S. with many laid-off workers having left the oilfield workforce permanently to move to other sectors of the economy. While the initial recruitment will comprise experienced oilfield hands, beyond the point, retraining will be needed. All of this is going to reverse the pricing trend in the U.S., albeit gradually, as operators will have to pay more to access high-quality service capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, with customers working through the duck or drill but uncompleted inventory, our completion and artificial lift activity levels will get a disproportionate boost on U.S. land. Internationally, we expect to see some flattening in Latin America, modest growth in the Europe/Caspian/Russia/Sub-Sahara Africa region, with the continued seasonal recovery into the summer in both Russia but to a lesser extent in Europe, aided further by market share gains in the Middle East and in some Asian markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pricing will not deteriorate any further from second-quarter levels but costs will continue to trend downwards. Based on this, we expect to see a gradual improvement in our second-half result, although on an overall basis, we do not expect to break even by year-end. Bernard will comment in more detail on the operating results, contract activity and wins and the outlook later on in this call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to cash flow and net debt. Free cash flow in the second quarter was a disappointing negative $160 million, while still improving on the first quarter's free cash flow by $56 million. The shortfall can be explained quite simply. Customers in general, but particularly national oil companies, have begun to manage their cash flows actively, thereby delaying payments to contractors. We missed about $150 million in specific projected collections reflected in the nine-day increase in our DSO this quarter. Obviously, these customers have solid credit and recoverability is not in question. Just the timing is delayed. As our customers will benefit from better oil prices going forward, we expect them to improve their payment cycle in the second half of the year and into next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, with the reduction in product sales, we could not hit our inventory reduction targets in the second quarter. And while we did reduce inventory levels in the quarter, we fell short by $50 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, the tender offer we made on our 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 bonds resulted in a settlement on June 30 accelerating payment of accrued interest of $27 million, which would otherwise have been paid in the third quarter. And lastly, we also accelerated the reduction in force program and incurred an additional $28 million in cash severance payments. These factors impacted our second quarter free cash flow by about $250 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current forecast for free cash flow for the year is in the range of a positive $100 million to $150 million (13:14). This implies a seasonal recovery in our cash flow generation in the second half of the year, which is normal for our industry. Our second half cash flow will be bolstered by improved results, stronger customer collections, lower inventory levels, much lower severance cash costs, absence of employee annual bonus payments and continued discipline in capital spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "CapEx is now targeted to be $200 million for the year, down another $50 million from the previous guidance. This low level of CapEx should not alarm anyone. Our CapEx is divided into three buckets: the manufacturing capacity, infrastructure capacity and technical equipment for our services business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of manufacturing capacity, we are currently running at just over a third of available capacity. In terms of service infrastructure, we are well built out globally and are materially underutilized currently. And finally, on the technical equipment front, we have objective utilization metrics for each product line in place, be it drilling services, wireline logging or pressure pumping. And based on detailed analyses, we believe we can support about 2.5 times the current levels of activity without adding any meaningful higher CapEx. As we grow into the upcycle, we can and we will maintain a tight lid on CapEx.\n",
    "\n",
    "Net debt increased by $187 million in the quarter to reach $6.8 billion. In the second quarter, we successfully upsized and issued $1.27 billion of convertible notes and $1.5 billion in five-year and seven-year senior debt at very good interest rates. A big part of these proceeds, totaling $1.9 billion, were used to buy back debt maturing in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, pursuant to the tender offer. And the rest of the proceeds were used to pay down the revolver.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these transactions, our maturity profile has changed substantially, derisking the liquidity profile of the company materially. Prior to these transactions, we had $2.1 billion of maturities over the next three years. Today, this number is a mere $639 million, with only $88 million due in 2017 and only $66 million due in 2018. The success of these transactions reflects investor confidence, both in the recovery of the sector as a whole and in Weatherford's strong performance in the backdrop of such a sector recovery. We are grateful for our investors' faith in us and we expect to exceed their expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One point of particular note here is that this springing maturity clause in our revolver linked to reducing the 2019 $1 billion bond maturity to less than $500 million by the fourth quarter of 2018, has already been neutralized, as the outstanding amount of the 2019 bond is now only $485 million. This means that the revolver now extends out to July of 2019 with no problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another noteworthy item is that all of our banks recently unanimously approved an amendment to our revolver agreement to iron out kinks and to ease certain restrictions that make it easier for Weatherford to operate. Additionally, an accordion feature of up to $250 million was added to the agreement to allow existing and new lenders to extend more capacity to the company going forward. All of these changes are positive for Weatherford and demonstrate the continuing support from our banking group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our long-term net debt will trend down. Our current intention is that in 2021, when the convertible debt becomes due, we expect to issue shares to our debtholders in exchange. This will structurally reduce our debt by $1.27 billion. Additionally, positive free cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the eventual sale of the Land Rigs business will also reduce net debt materially. All of this goes to further delever and derisk the company. Longer term, we continue to target a 25% to 30% debt to cap ratio and recover our investment grade credit ratings. As of June 30, available liquidity was $1.8 billion, including $1.3 billion of revolver capacity and $452 million of cash balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating EBITDA for the quarter was flat with Q1 at $58 million. As to specified EBITDA as defined in our revolver agreement, it came in at $130 million for the quarter. The key specified debt to specified EBITDA ratio at June 30 was 1.0 times versus a covenant of 3.0 times, meaning we have ample headroom on the covenant. The same ratio including LCs was 2.04 times, which is also well below the covenant of 4.0 times. Our projections for the rest of the year suggest that we maintain the substantial headroom on the covenant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Weatherford is now materially derisked from a liquidity standpoint, has a clear achievable plan to delever over the next several years and the company is now at the takeoff point as the market recovers, with industry-leading earnings and cash flow incrementals.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, I will now turn the call over to Bernard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you, Krishna. Good morning, everyone. A few comments on Q2. The second quarter evolved as we expected. We thought NAM would trough, and it did. In spite of a devastating cover (19:30) in Q2, making a severe activity drop that much worse for NAM, operating income actually improved significantly. This is entirely due to cost management and excellent operating execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thought the Eastern Hemisphere would not deteriorate further in Q2 and this was correct. We have cross-currents in Q2 for the Eastern Hemisphere. Pricing concessions during our prior quarters impacted the quarter. This conflicted with some early startups and powerful cost cuts. The end result was marginal declines in overall revenues and flat profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "We viewed Latin America as having a very weak prognosis. This proved also and unfortunately correct. Mexico, Colombia, our largest market, Brazil and even Argentina, all weakened further, in some instances, dramatically. By way of an illustration, our largest client in our largest national market, Colombia, moved their rig activity in late 2014 from 30 rigs within plan for over 40 to zero in this second quarter. In the course of the quarter, the client went actually down to zero drilling rigs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2 showed exemplary decremental of 6%, an 11% decline in sequential revenues. We expect these will be industry-leading decrementals. They reflect above all the very aggressive cost actions taken from day one of the downcycle. We've had the best, as in lowest, decrementals, consistently. Lastly, Q2 was to be the last quarter with the ongoing Zubair project and it was. Zubair is completed. You won't hear of Zubair anymore. It is a closed issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "On cash flow, a long-term focus and objective, profitability, CapEx, inventory and cash payment of the 15 operating bonuses traditionally paid in Q2, all were by and large as planned. We had two unexpected events: accelerated Q3 payments into Q2 and delayed receivables collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The acceleration of payments for severance execution was one of the two accelerations. Almost all the Q3 was pushed into Q2 as we accelerated our payroll cuts to end the layoff program earlier. Acceleration of three payments of Q3 interest expense in addition to Q2's scheduled interest payments. This is a byproduct of the debt tender offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delayed receivables collection. As Krishna mentioned, the delays are all – well, they're all NOCs, a few IOCs, too. This isn't a credit or a collection issue. This is an industry phenomenon. Why did large clients slow down payments? Because they could. In Q2's extremely depressed environment, it was possible. The net result was a significant shortfall in scheduled collections at quarter's end. All this added up to $200 million, $250 million swing in our free cash flow. The swing isn't lost. It will benefit the second half of 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2 synthesis and forward views. Looking at Q2, a few conclusions are clear to us. NAM profit in Q1 profitability wise and Q2 revenue wise. NAM is now turning, however slowly, but turning it is. Eastern Hemisphere crossed in Q2. Same observation. Eastern Hemisphere as a whole is turning, however slowly, but turning it is. Latin America will continue to remain challenged. We don't see it turning, not in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on forward views, these comments apply to Weatherford. We incorporated market trends but with idiosyncratic specificity. We are a little different from the others. Only half our product lines overlapped the big three, essentially completion and formation evaluation and our recent market share history is also different.\n",
    "\n",
    "First half of this year reflected the psychology of a $25 oil market, which is essentially a forced liquidation of the industry's capabilities. Volume activity worldwide and pricing conditions reached levels unseen in any management's lifetime, including this one. Second half of this year will reflect a $40, $45 oil market psychology, which will make it the beginnings of a recovery, albeit from extraordinarily low levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The oilfield will slowly pull out of the extreme operating conditions it was placed under. Progress will occur, but step by step and not everywhere. Oil bears need not fret. The recovery will be short with a minimum activity levels required to sustain, let alone grow, a flat worldwide oil production capacity. This means on the whole our clients in the second half will continue to lower their oil production overall and de facto capacity. In effect, second half of this year, we won't be able to overcome decline rates either. Worldwide oil production capacity will be lower at year-end than it was at the end of Q2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geographically, activity gains will be predominantly land and concentrated in three regions: North America, MENA and Russia. The rest will, by and large, flatten out. NAM will slowly rise in activity with all segments benefiting. Completion and lift will be the strongest first beneficiaries as will pressure pumping. The capacity overhang in that segment limits their near-term potential. Completion, our completion, is seeing for the first time in many quarters an increase in orders and activity on a number of U.S. land plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "On lift, we have seen recent improvements in orders in new equipment, suggesting both the end of our client destocking and some activity increases. Lift prognosis matters for us in NAM. It is a very large and normally very profitable pipeline with low beta. But when conditions deteriorate to an extreme, as they recently have, lift, our lift, becomes much higher beta than understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain further. We are the largest payer worldwide, including North America, in all forms of lift, except ESPs. Normally, lift is an island of resilience and stability. With the unprecedented collapse of North American activity, lift experienced high beta with major client destocking of new and parts inventory, as well as severe curtailment of the new well market. This deterioration was much worse than the ESP segment because the types of wells ESPs address keep their low beta. As a correlation, our lift and our non-ESP lift peers have much more to recover with a turn in the market. De facto in this particular cycle, our NAM lift pipeline has become high beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eastern Hemisphere will arrest its decline volume-wise and experience a modest recovery. Expect the first manifest rise in activity late in Q3 and squarely in Q4. This will not apply to the entire hemisphere, Russia and MENA will show by far the most improvements, both a combination of activity increases and market share gains in our case. The Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Emirates, are the prime movers for us. Middle East will be an island of strength in the second half. There are also some Eastern Hemisphere markets that will lag, but at a minimum, these markets will stabilize with no further declines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latin America on the whole will start second half weak. It will flatten before year-end. The activity declines will arrest. But it will not experience much steady recovery, not this year. There will be shifts in national markets and clients, but overall, the prognosis of the market is for soft followed by flat outlook for the second half. That makes Latin America the laggard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two targets we'll fight for. We may reach break-even profitability operating income in North America by first half of next year, first half 2017. On the back of high expected volume incrementals and the full effect of cost cuts, we assume in this respect very little improvements in pricing in that turnaround timeframe. Two, Eastern Hemisphere may return to double-digit operating income margin, albeit just low end of the double-digit in Q4 – this is, therefore, Q4 of this year – Q4 2016, on the back of high expected incrementals.\n",
    "\n",
    "And again, much of the strong incrementals expected after the credit of the cost revolution at Weatherford, which brings me to cost and organizational change. I want to touch on a number of operational issues because I believe we are at a turning point in the cycle and the turning point of two-year cost and operating transformation. And I believe it portends a strong performance at Weatherford.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first half of the year, we have reduced our global employee count by another 7,800. Our full employee count stands today at just 32,000, down from 55,300 on January 1, 2015, 18 months ago. This is a 42% contraction of our total payroll in 18 months. The organization has been delayered on average by a third. The support ratio in direct-to-direct labor dropped further to 37.8%. Early in 2014, it stood at near 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "No other statistic tells the story like the support ratio. This almost cutting in half was accomplished in the midst of a very sharp decline in direct head count, and it's extremely difficult to get done. Simply said, we have step-changed, as in made efficient, our support structure. We did this in addition to direct cost action, even though direct labor was hammered very hard. This is important because future incrementals will benefit immensely productivity turns. Our low support ratio will drive powerful absorption when volume increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsibility and accountability have been pushed to the sand face, as close to the field as possible, which means less Dubai, Singapore, Moscow, Houston, et cetera, more Dhahran, Sakhalin, U.K. and Midland, et cetera. Supply chain as in manufacturing, procurement, logistics have been restructured with efficiency gains at all levels. We made large gains in procurement and logistics already. Manufacturing is still in the process of being restructured but metrics for work center rates and times of delivery have already improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating and financial management have been upgraded thoroughly from the leadership through the ranks. It is self-evident at the leadership level. It runs deep through the ranks. HR has been empowered at all levels of the organization, with an emphasis on training and career development. Operational compensation is geared toward free cash flow returns, quality and safety. With the turn, return metrics become increasingly important, as will quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3, but even more so Q4, will capture the full benefit of all the cost actions taken, which brings me to forward operating priorities. Other than a few local exceptions, people and delayering cost reductions are completed. We're calling for an end to the payroll-related cost drive. There will not be any further contraction. The current level of 32,000 worldwide employees will be our low point. We are also calling for an end to all price discounting. This is a company-wide formal decision and process. No tender or bid submission will be priced lower than Q2 levels effective now. This is the first step towards price recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, price recovery will be a powerful driver of financial results. Pricing worldwide, not just North America, reached levels which we have never experienced before, not by a wide margin. Pricing levels are unsustainable long term for our industry. We are not banking on pricing alone to drive margin improvements. The level of support cost ratio at end of Q2 of 38.8% is so far from its historical levels of years ago with obviously (32:08) very high incrementals when high activity comes through, viewed as a particularly powerful absorption booster of high business volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the cost side, what will be left as a work in process are ongoing two-year productivity and efficiency internal projects centered around supply chain, maintenance cycles and invoicing processes, with powerful structural cost and cash flow efficiency implications. This will benefit 2017 and later years.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice we started to add a few operating news in our quarterly results, be they contract wins we view as directionally important or particular agreements, such as our joint effort with IBM. We've spent much over the last two years talking about layoffs, shutdowns and curtailments. When we didn't, we talked about liquidity, banking facilities and balance sheet constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today our capitalization is structurally safe, with action taken in June. We have ample liquidity and time. This doesn't change our financial priorities. The company's culture, compensation and focus is on free cash flow generation and returns as key metrics of performance. It is set. It is ingrained in our DNA and it won't change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, legacy issues, whether administrative, legal and contractual, are closed, and our cost structure is at an unprecedented low level, of which much is perennial. With all this achieved and all behind us, it is time we focused on clients, technology, product development and the impact we as a company can make on the industry. With our specialization and unique toolbox and technology capabilities we have, we have much to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "By year end, Weatherford's maturation process, at least in our opinion, will be essentially completed. The company had years of extremely aggressive growth and development in its formative years. It had then many years of success, but it also paid a high administrative and operational price with speed and rate of growth. Even if all issues are closed, the lesson is learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, our industry's unprecedented depression in depth and longevity allowed us to step-change faster and further when needed to be changed. That includes our cost structure, refocus on strengths, product line infrastructure and selected market share opportunities to the exclusion of all else. So it allowed us to adopt cash generation and return metrics as financial objectives throughout the organization and change our culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the overly aggressive earlier stages of the company part of our history buried and gone, all that Weatherford focused on financial priorities and operating performance. The market is turning. It feels slow, hesitant, frail, worrisome. But make no mistake, it is as frustrating as it will be powerful when some time has run. The oilfield service industry, our industry, is a coiled spring. And within the industry, Weatherford is especially tightly coiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A session.\n",

    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",

    "Bernard, could you expand on the recovery path for Eastern Hemisphere margins by year end? We're going effectively from break-even to low-double digits by year end. Are those basically costs that have already been taken out of the system that didn't necessarily manifest themselves on the P&L in the second quarter and should begin to blossom in Q3 and Q4?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "I think when you look at the margin expansion we're planning to get...\n",
    "\n",
    "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "...which I agree is a big number if we are to achieve our targets, you will see that about a large third of it is driven by simply incorporation of the cost actions we took to the P&L.\n",
    "\n",
    "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not so much that we acted later throughout the Eastern Hemisphere. It just takes longer simply because of regulations and culture in those places. So our assessment, it was pretty good on the cost metrics, on figuring out what will happen. Our assessment, again, is that it will take just about full effect in Q4 and most of the effect in Q3. So Q3 will already benefit Q4 in full on the cost side and then drive a large third of the margin improvements that we're hoping to see in dollar terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance at two-thirds or a small two-thirds is really nothing more but a measurement of the activity that we see as very – well, not only likely, but planned for. We are increasing volume of activity in a number of Middle Eastern markets. It's not a large number, but it's in a number of markets. We can measure what that means. We know the profitability of the contracts. And we can measure it. And if you add all of that, it provides us to a certain dollar margin for the fourth quarter, which combined with the costs, brings us to somewhere between 10% to 11% very specifically, operating income margins for MENAP because Asia Pacific is combined with it. Asia will not change very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\n",
    "\n",
    "Right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "A little bit of cost benefit, but not change very much. So it's all driven by MENA. And so we see that – which allows us to say that we can see that particular part of our business being driven to our double-digit results.\n",
    "\n",
    "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. So to be clear, the double-digit aspiration is for MENAP and not necessarily Eastern Hemisphere?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",

    "No. It's Eastern Hemisphere. I just covered the part of it that...\n",

    "The rest case is seasonal in the case of Russia, which is very powerful. And look at cost cuts. Cost cuts and seasonal. The European side doesn't move that much in terms of activity. It's just cost.\n",

    "Okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",

    "So the one that was more granular was MENA. Forgive me.\n",
    "\n",
    "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. Thanks. And in the second line of inquiries here is, I think Krishna referenced putting two fleets back to work in North America in July. And I just want to drill down a little bit on your frac fleet in North America. I think you have something along the order of, kind of 900,000 horsepower in North America and, first, how much of that is working? Second, what's the health of the fleet? And I'm just kind of wondering about how much of your idle capacity can go back to work in short order with a minimal amount of CapEx.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'll cover some of the aspects and, Krishna, fill in the blanks. We have, originally, 23 spreads and we would calibrate the spread at just about 50,000 horsepower a piece, a bit more than 900,000 horsepower in the U.S. However, we feel today we only have 20 there realistically. Out of the 20 spreads, so it would be 1 million horsepower, rather than the prior number, we have 10 which is hot-stacked. Well, 10 market and also hot-stacked, and 10 which is cold-stacked. The 10 that are hot-stacked went all the way down to five operating as recently as Q2 and the five becomes seven.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you will, seven out of 10 are active, seven actually under contract and three which are ready to go, assuming we can find the crews. The other 10 cold-stacked are being minimally maintained. They're not just being – they're not being dilapidated. They're not being sort of cannibalized and the rest of it. There is a CapEx involved with the other 10, which Krishna will cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks, Bernard. So yeah, first of all, to bring the three hot-stacked fleets back on there's minimal. Absolutely. We're talking about three weeks' time to bring those fleets back to work with very, very minimal expenditure. The cold-stacked fleets will, roughly, take about $5 million to $7 million each, with about a four-week turnaround time to bring each fleet back. So we could work on all those fleets concurrently of course. So really, the CapEx needed, additional CapEx needed to bring the 10 cold-stacked fleets back to work is actually quite minimal for a company of our size. And we are very cognizant of the market, working closely with our customers and we should be able to react quite quickly to any kind of upswing in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in perspective, Bill, think on the cold-stacked which is half of our fleet, the 10 out of the 20, about $150 of horsepower on average to bring them back to the market. They have been, again, minimally maintained. They have not been cannibalized.\n",

    "Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey. Good morning.\n",

    "\n",
    "So just looking to expand on that discussion on the pumping fleet, as you think about the restart of activity and the impact of pricing, I think you noted in the prepared remarks some tightening of labor. Just curious as you think about pricing progression, do you expect to see some concessions from your customers on pass-through cost first before you can get toward the net pricing? Just curious how that dynamic will play out as activity were to pick up?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Sean, you are absolutely right on that. It is a utilization story. In North America, the way the recovery unfolds, which you know very well, is you start getting more fleets back to work. The overall utilization of the U.S. fleet, not just our fleet, but industry fleet, has to reach a certain threshold before we then start gradually renegotiating terms and conditions, which include pass-through, et cetera.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's how the pricing improvement starts manifesting. Eventually at some point, when the market picks up to a certain threshold, then you start having a little bit tightness both in equipment and in labor in terms of shortage. That's when you start getting a little bit more pricing power. But we don't envisage anything in our assumptions on pricing for the rest of this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Sean, also be careful that – be careful, be mindful more so than careful, that in the breadth of our product lines lift, completion, well construction and so forth, we've had absolutely also terrible pricing and you're probably a bit more likely to see our pricing – I wouldn't say strong pricing, no, but some pricing move in the other products and service lines rather than pressure pumping. Pressure pumping will really be initially by our assessment utilization game for quite some time, until you get to a level of utilization where it's more natural to get some pricing relief.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC\n",
    "\n",
    "Right. I think that's fair. And then just to circle back on the updated free cash flow guidance, there's some moving parts. I was just hoping you could give us a little more detail, particularly I was thinking around the working capital, how that component's going to help you achieve those targets for the second half.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n",
    "\n",
    "Right. So, first of all, receivables, we should – I mentioned that NOCs are managing their cash flow actively. This is an industry thing. It's not a Weatherford thing. And we expect that to continue through the second half. We think NOCs worldwide are going to continue to manage their cash flow quite actively through to the end of the year. So the DSO will stay where it is, but obviously, the collections in the second half will exceed that. That's on a prorated basis, what we saw in the second quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inventory levels initially for the first, I would say, six to none months starting now, will actually dip because there will be a step-up in activity. That's our assumption based on what we're seeing in the marketplace. So you'll see inventory levels dip a little bit before we need to start restocking. Restocking will start some time mid next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in terms of working capital, we expect to see some inventory declines. We expect to see an increase, marginal increase in receivable balances and payables will go with the business. If a business goes up, the payables will increase as we go forward, allowing us to manage the receivables from a liquidity perspective. So it'll be a little bit of a mixed bag, I would say, kind of flattish working capital for the next six months to nine months and then gradual increase after that as the business picks up to a new level\n",

    "And your next question comes from the line of Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, gentlemen. I want to drill down on your ability to respond in an upturn. I think, Krishna, you mentioned that activity would need to improve 2.5 times before you need meaningful CapEx? First of all, did I hear that right? And how does that apply by product line and by geographic areas? Is North America going to be the same? For example, 2.5 times where we are today is 1,100 rigs before you really need to spend any CapEx.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll give some element of comment for Marshall and Krishna will add. It's actually even a bit more than that. The manufacturing capabilities can accommodate three times more volume, not two-and-a-half. The infrastructure, which is a bit of an artificial measurement, the roofline that we developed over the year is so wide and actually, so – is get up a much higher volume, can also accommodate throughput three times the volume that we presently have easily. The 2.5 times concerns the tool deployed in the field. Whether it's completion service tools or whether it's LWD kits at both ends of the spectrum, that's what Krishna was referring to and all of these numbers are absolutely correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "We actually do not need to expand manufacturing or infrastructure, period, in the foreseeable future because three times the volume, even in a recovery, is a lot. In terms of the service tools that I just mentioned and all the formation evaluation tools, as you can tell also, 2.5 times is a vast number. In addition to which I will tell you, we are improving really by a large measure the intensity of use of our tools, which if anything, will tend to make the 2.5 times bigger number and all last longer, if you will. As volume comes in, we'll still have that kind of ability to accommodate more business.\n",
    "\n",
    "So CapEx, we're not starving the business. It's not the business, which is being deprived of anything. The reality is we have very long assets. We can use assets. We are using assets. We've learned how to do that intelligently and although CapEx with activity obviously will grow, you'll be surprised by how modest it is and it's not worth suppressing our capabilities at all. It's just that we spent much in past years and it has not been wasted. That's really all. Krishna, do you want to add to that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah, I'd like to add, just to give some context here as well. In the last two years or so, we have immensely strengthened the management of our product lines. People in the field, the product line people in the field, they have asset-sharing objectives and that cultural change has happened nicely over the last two years. So today, they all carry a global CapEx objective by product line. Every product line has got utilization metrics, which are now embedded, people understand them and sharing of tools is one aspect of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other aspect of it is to localize the repairs and maintenance. So we have opened up R&M centers locally in many geographies in the last two years. What this does is that when a tool goes down after using it in a job, it gets now maintained and repaired locally and is redeployed immediately back in the field from where it came as opposed to the past when it would have to come back to Houston or go back to the U.K. It would take months and months of turnaround time, which means you had to have a huge number of backup tools in every country to cope with that R&M kind of facility that we had, in the centralized facility that we had.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, having localized everything, we have much more confidence in telling you that we don't need that many backup tools as before. This is part of the transformation of Weatherford, just the way we are managing our global fleet of tools, the way we are managing the deployment of tools and the repair and maintenance of tools. So all of this goes into the kind of statistic that I was talking about, 2.5 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "We manage our costs down. We talk a lot about it because it's easy to measure people. What we don't talk as much about is the quality of the people and the priorities they have or the operating guidelines they have or the culture change. We also don't talk as much either as to the work we've done on around the assets, understanding the asset base we have, understanding how to use it more efficiently. There's enormous amounts of headroom in us doing that, but we've done all three at the same time. We just put the emphasis on just the raw numbers of people leaving and the cost measurement because it's just easier to get your head around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n",
    "\n",
    "So really, our ability to manage the upswing in terms of physical tools and CapEx is actually very, very strong without meaningfully adding to CapEx and eroding our cash flow going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "And in closing, that doesn't have anything to do with availability of capital. It has to do with returns. That was a returns-driven initiative.\n",
    "\n",
    "J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a surprisingly high number and that's good color and helps me understand how you get there. The other surprising thing that I heard was I think, Krishna, you mentioned you're already starting to see a little bit of a tightening in the labor side, maybe six weeks to re-staff a frac crew today. If activity is, let's say, 30%, 50% higher than today, how long do you think it'd take you to hire out and train a crew?\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not alone in this. Our peers are also recruiting hand over fist right now or to staff some few additional crews that they're putting out there. So I think, frankly, as an industry – there's no empirical verification of this, of course – but I would say the first 25%, 30%, 40% increase, physical activity, it'll be fairly straightforward to recruit back some of the labor that have been laid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, it'll get really tight. So I would say up to 600 oil rigs, it should be fairly easy. After that, it gets tighter. So we will reach a situation where we tell the customers we have the equipment but we have less people. We don't have people to run it. And that's what I was talking about in my prepared comments that the crunch will come on people first, then it'll come on equipment much later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "You know, Marshall, at the end of the day, what he means is the elasticity response of North America on the oil side, meaning on the production, on the capacity side, is overstated. The simple reason that – forget the reservoir issues and whether the other zones we can go after are as productive as the ones we're going after and blah, blah, blah. Forget that. That's one issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the other issue is just the sheer ability for the industry to bounce back. Of course, it will. Will take much longer. It is not normal, the depression we went through. It lasted much longer, much, much, much longer. It's already twice as long as 2009 and deeper. And there are consequences, and the consequences is measured with the elasticity of response.\n",
    "\n",
    "J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "And presumably, that's when pricing goes hyperbolic when you start to run into those bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah, that's not what we want as an industry. But that's correct. We don't make the rules.\n",

    "Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you. Thank you. Good thing. So I just wanted to follow up on two things. First, focus on the cash flow dynamic you guys outlined, what you expect for the full-year cash flow generation. Just wondering how you guys are risk assessing getting to that cash flow number in that context and maybe what percentage of working capital is going to represent that cash flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Krishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n",
    "\n",
    "So, obviously, there's a number of elements in our second-half cash flow guidance. We see an improvement in earnings, as Bernard mentioned in his comments, with growth both in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere, excluding Latin America. Latin America is not going to grow. And there's also, of course, the working capital release, both mainly from inventories really and some amount of receivables as well just flowing through from the Q2.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I think from a risk assessment standpoint, these are the main assumptions we have because the rest of it, the severance is going to go down because we've accelerated much of it into the second quarter. Interest payments actually will go down as well in cash terms because, again, because of the acceleration into the second quarter. And the Zubair contract will be cash positive, more so in the second half, much more so than in the first half. So when you aggregate all of the moving pieces, these are the things – most of it should happen as planned.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think from a risk standpoint, commodity prices, activity levels, et cetera, those are the elements of it. But I'd like to mention that no matter what the numbers are, the implications are completely dampened now because from a liquidity and capital structure standpoint, as we mentioned earlier, and the covenant management, there is no issue at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's summarize, Kurt. I'll add a couple of things also if you want to get more comfort, which is that we always have a large operating bonus payment in Q2, every Q2 of every year. It's in the range of $18 million. It occurs in one quarters, in Q2. This is the routine. But it won't occur in Q3, Q4. There you are. The other thing, also, as you take a look, for no particular reason, the individual agreements, tables were taken down quite a lot in Q2 also. These are all obvious things you'll see fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I will mention also so that's one set of factors. And Krishna is right. We're not a company which has any issues of either liquidity or anything like that. We have now the kind of capital structure that we want and we do feel that we can take the net debt number down to, if you analyze the numbers, to $4 billion as a matter of three different events, which is free cash flow and the sale of assets, which is rigs. And also in our minds, we believe the conversion of the convertible into equity takes you down just mechanically very easily to $4 billion. And from there on, we'll take it down further.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's all very clear. Do not assume, though, because we believe that the measurement of free cash flow is not the critical only measurement that matters at Weatherford anymore. Don't presume that we don't have within the organization ingrained in everyone's metrics the importance of free cash flow. That won't change precisely because we intend to make generous free cash flow in the years ahead, not just in the second half of the year. This is perennial. So don't assume because we say this that we don't view free cash flow generation as critical when we run the company. This is actually the measurement of success long term of any company.\n",

    "And then, not yet. My follow-up is, so you mentioned break-even in a couple of different contexts. One on operating income, I think that was related specifically to North America. And then, Krishna, I think your reference to break-even was on an earnings per share basis. Can you guys clarify?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\n",
    "\n",
    "What I put forth is what we see internally, which is we see a path towards North America going from what was $100 million negative operating profit in Q2, which is better than Q1 to being break-even. That's one. And we see that occurring the first half of next year, Q1 or Q2.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of reasons for that and, of course, it depends also on oil being reasonable and so forth and so on. But a lot of it are things we control. This is one thing. What Krishna mentioned, separate and distinct, is simply the fact that he doesn't see – and he's right – how we can predictably be able to make enough of a progress to be able to be break-even this year.\n",

       "  \"Operator: Good morning, and welcome to today's ConAgra Foods First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This program is being recorded. My name is Jessica Morgan, and I'll be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host from ConAgra Foods for today's program; Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer; and Johan Nystedt, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Nystedt.\\nJohan Nystedt: Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. And while we are making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which include cautionary language. Also we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found either in the earnings press release, Q&A or on our website at investor.conagrafoods.com, click Financial Reports & Filings, then Non-GAAP Reconciliations. Now I'll turn it over to Sean.\\nSean Connolly: Thanks, Johan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter conference call. This will be our last earnings call as ConAgra Foods as we anticipate completing the Lamb Weston spin-off this fall prior to the holidays. As you've probably seen by now, we announced the timing of dedicated Investor Days for each business. Lamb Weston's will be held in New York City on October 13, and ConAgra Brands will be held on October 18 here in Chicago. Our teams are hard at work preparing for these meetings, and we are excited about the opportunity to take you through a deeper dive on these businesses and why we believe they will create significant value for investors as separate pure-play public companies. Each company will share more details, including financial outlooks and capital allocation priorities at these events. We are confident you will see the unique opportunities available to both companies and why each is well positioned to seize them. Now on to the state of the business and our first quarter results. Once again, it was a very busy quarter at ConAgra as we continue our disciplined and methodical approach to enhancing focus, expanding margins, improving efficiency, energizing our culture and ultimately, creating value for our shareholders. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with the progress that we have made to date. At a high level, we saw strong results from both Lamb Weston and our branded consumer businesses. On Lamb, we once again saw what a terrific business this is. Sales were up, margins were up and profit was up. The team is looking forward to sharing much more about this jewel of a business on October 13. On our branded consumer businesses, we also made terrific progress. Here, we are seeing clear evidence that our strategy to upgrade our revenue base and expand margins is working. As we have discussed previously, we are intensely focused on positioning our U.S. branded portfolio for long-term success and that starts with building a higher-quality revenue base. As we will discuss in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we compete in good categories with many well-known brands that are Number 1 or Number 2 in their categories. However, ConAgra historically prioritized volume over value and accordingly, we've been overly reliant on deep discounting as our chief demand driver, leading us to under-invest and under-deliver on brand building and innovation. In short, we underleveraged some of our greatest assets. The result of this behavior is a revenue base that is overdeveloped in terms of the presence of low-loyalty, price-focused consumers. The problem with catering to these consumers is that, (a) it caused us to neglect the needs of the vast majority of our consumer base, people who are hungry for innovation and premiumization and, (b) it fundamentally limited our ability to drive higher margins. We are changing that. Specifically, to ensure we leverage our brand strength and unlock our margin potential, we have been methodically infusing focus and discipline around pricing and trade promotion while investing in brand building and innovation. Said differently, we are focusing our efforts on practices that support value over volume and walking away from our previous practices that concentrated on volume over value. It is important to understand that while our efforts to improve brand building and innovation are broad-based, the volume declines we're experiencing are largely concentrated within brands that historically targeted the price-focused consumer and heavily relied on deep discounts and promotion to drive volume. In fact, if you dig into the scanner data, you will see that more than 80% of our Q1 volume declines can be attributed to just six brands that have historically been underpriced and over-promoted. We are confident that our actions represent the right way to maximize the value of our branded portfolio over time. As a supporting data point, gross margins on our U.S. retail brands are up about 700 basis points since Q1 two years ago. As we continue to execute this strategy, we believe our revenue base will be better positioned to deliver stronger, more consistent performance over the long term. We have framed our efforts here around five portfolio management principles, or PMPs as we call them, which guide how we intend to manage our branded portfolio going forward. At our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we will go deep on each of these, but I want to give you a sense of our approach. PMP number 1 is upgrading the revenue base. The second PMP is refreshing the core. PMP number 3 is assigning clear portfolio roles. The fourth PMP is ramping up innovation and M&A. And the fifth PMP is effectively backing the winners. These principles represent a tried-and-true approach and in a few weeks we will discuss the progress we're making on each and how they will help build a more focused, higher-margin and higher-performing branded food company over time. One note on PMP number 4, ramping up innovation and M&A. I'm sure you've all seen the news from earlier this week about our acquisition of the Frontera, Red Fork and Salpica brands. These businesses make authentic gourmet Mexican food and contemporary American cooking sauces. We believe this gives us another great platform to provide consumers with unique, high-quality food products. And as an extra enticement to attend our Investor Day on October 18, I promise you will have a chance to sample these tremendous brands. While we have a lot more work to do, I want to acknowledge our sales force for doing an excellent job working with our retailers to explain how our change in strategy benefits them as well as ConAgra. Similarly, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team for anticipating these volume changes and proactively offsetting any loss absorption benefits. With that context in mind, let's turn to our Q1 results. Q1 net sales declined 5% and the impact of divestitures and FX represented about 2 percentage points of the decline. As I mentioned at the outset, Lamb Weston delivered another strong top line this quarter, offset by sales results in our domestic consumer business. In the U.S. consumer market, which, as you know, is challenged across our competitive set, we saw declines due to the actions I just outlined related to upgrading our revenue base. This, along with the impact of FX, more than offset an increase in price and mix. Overall profitability was driven by growth and margin expansion in Lamb Weston as well as continued strong gross margin expansion in our domestic consumer businesses. As a result, total segment adjusted operating profit was up 23%. Additionally, our supply chain team continues to excel at finding more efficient ways to manufacture our products and reduce costs. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.61 for the quarter, representing 49% growth from the prior year, significantly in excess of our mid to high teens growth estimate. As Dave will point out, some of this is timing related. Now turning to segment performance. As you saw in this morning's release, we are now reporting results in five reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, the Refrigerated & Frozen, the International and the Foodservice segments represent the businesses that will remain with ConAgra Brands and will become the primary four reporting segments of the independent company postspin. The Commercial segment consists primarily of the Lamb Weston business.  Starting with the Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales decreased 5% based on the actions I just discussed. These efforts, coupled with increased pricing and trade productivity, savings and supply chain and continued SG&A discipline, helped drive growth of 31% in adjusted segment operating income, which translated to a 680 basis points expansion in adjusted segment operating margin. The volume declines in this segment were largely concentrated on a few brands where we are reversing our historical practice of promoting below the $1 price point. Chef Boyardee, and Snack Pack are good examples. Importantly, we saw the margin and profit expansion that we were counting on. Equally important, key sales fundamentals like distribution remained on plan reflecting customer support for our strategy shift towards stronger brands and innovation. Keep in mind, the plan does include some important SKU rationalization. So when you see TPDs pull back in the near term, recognize that is part of a disciplined program to reduce non-value-added complexity while increasing facings and velocity on priority SKUs. You'll hear more about this at our ConAgra Brands Investor Day in Dave Biegger's supply chain presentation.  Last point I'll make in this segment is that we continue to benefit from disciplined investment behind A&P-ready brands, such as Slim Jim and PAM among others. Now turning to the Refrigerated & Frozen segment. Net sales decreased 8% while adjusted operating profit increased by 310 basis points to 16% of net sales. The volume decline in this segment was heavily focused on Banquet, an important brand, as you know, is going through a significant makeover. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work to restage our Banquet brand resulting in increased pricing associated with long-overdue product and packaging upgrades. Accordingly, this was the primary driver of the volume and sales decline in the segment for the quarter. Banquet is now benefiting from much stronger margins, and our consumer data is also showing an improving buying rate from our most loyal consumers and key customers. As we move through the next calendar year and begin to wrap these actions, you will see top line sales declines moderate. From there, we will also fold in new product improvements and innovation. Regarding segment profitability here in Q1, our disciplined pricing actions and supply chain productivity more than offset the Banquet impact and the costs related to a product recall. One other planned action in Q1 is worth noting in Frozen. While Marie Callender's is not one of our historically over-promoted brands, it was over-promoted in the year-ago period. And that was not a good business decision, so we did not repeat it in Q1 this year. These two contributed to our volume decline, but, again, we saw the margin gains we were counting on. Elsewhere in the segment, we saw solid top line performance, namely in Reddi-wip, which continues to be a strong performer for us. The International segment, net sales decreased 6% due to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the effects of currency, segment net sales would have been approximately equal to the prior year's comparable quarter. Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 1%, and adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $24 million. This segment was negatively affected by normalization of egg prices after last year's avian influenza outbreak. Overall, the four segments that will primarily comprise ConAgra Brands' ongoing operation postspin have made good progress, demonstrating the strength of our plan and the opportunity that lies ahead. Much of our team have completed their first full quarter in our new headquarters in Chicago, at the Merchandise Mart, and there is tremendous energy and excitement to build upon our momentum as a pure-play branded company. Now turning to Commercial foods. As I said at the outset of my remarks, Lamb Weston delivered another great quarter, generating approximately 4% net sales growth. In our reported results, the strength of Lamb Weston's performance is masked by the fact that we include the impact of the divestures of Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank, which were completed at the end of July. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 33% in the quarter behind Lamb Weston's continued growth and favorable input costs. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, leveraging its strong brand to capture emerging markets and international growth. Tom and the Lamb team look forward to sharing much more during their Investor Day on October 13 in New York. Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our talented employees. Amidst significant change, including a successful move to our new headquarters, our team remained focused on delivering our goals and serving our customers. In addition to driving strong performance, our team is also dedicated to being a good corporate citizen, and we were honored to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the sixth consecutive year, demonstrating recognition of our commitment to environmental and social goals in addition to economic objectives. Now turning to one of our newest team members, I would like to welcome our new CFO, Dave Marberger, who joins us from Prestige Brands. Dave brings more than 30 years of finance and leadership experience to ConAgra Foods, including ten years as the CFO at Godiva Chocolatier and Tasty Baking Company. I first got to know Dave during his time with the Campbell Soup Company, and Dave is a proven and accomplished finance executive, and I am confident he will be a tremendous asset going forward. We are extremely happy to welcome him to the team. With that, Dave, over to you.\\nDave Marberger: Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my comments, I would like to say how energized I am to be part of this organization and leadership team. I look forward to getting to know many of you and the investor community in the weeks and months ahead. I will address several topics in my comments, including our new reporting segments; a recap of our 2017 fiscal first quarter performance; a summary of items impacting comparability, including some brief comments on goodwill impairment, cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet; and some brief comments on our upcoming Investor Day. As we outlined in the release, we now report our business results in five segments. They are Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments were previously included in our Consumer Foods segment and Foodservice was previously included in our Commercial Foods segment. Upon the completion of the Lamb Weston spin, the commercial segment will include only the historical results of JM Swank and Spicetec through the divestiture date, and the Lamb Weston results will be reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. Now I will provide some comments on our performance for our fiscal 2017 first quarter. Please note that references to adjusted earnings or operating profit referred to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Overall, net sales for the fiscal first quarter approximated $2.7 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter. The divestiture of JM Swank and Spicetec and the negative impact of foreign exchange accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the net sales decline versus the year-ago quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fiscal first quarter of $0.42 compared with $0.38 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.61, 49% above the $0.41 delivered in the year-ago quarter and better than we planned. The strong first quarter EPS performance primarily reflects the benefits from continued gross margin expansion, lower SG&A expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume, lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture and some costs related to a product recall. As I will discuss later, the first quarter overdelivery versus our plan was driven, in part, by timing items for both SG&A and A&P expense. In our Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $757 million for the quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 6% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $185 million in the first quarter versus $142 million in the year-ago quarter. The strong increase in adjusted profit reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts, driven by pricing discipline and favorable product cost and productivity; reduced SG&A costs; and lower A&P spending due to timing, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume. In our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, net sales were $605 million for the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago period, reflecting an 11% decline in volume and a 3% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $97 million in the first quarter versus $85 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in adjusted profit reflects the same continued progress on margin expansion efforts as outlined for the Grocery & Snacks segment, offset by approximately $9 million of costs related to a product recall. In our International segment, net sales were $195 million for the quarter, down 6% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 2% decline in volume, a 1.5% improvement in price mix and a negative 5% impact from foreign exchange. We reported a segment operating loss of $149 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by a pretax impairment charge of $164 million related to our Canadian business. I'll say more about this shortly. Adjusted segment operating profit was $15 million in the first quarter versus $17 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in adjusted profit reflects lower sales in gross margins and a negative impact from FX, partially offset by modestly lower A&P and SG&A expenses. In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $268 million for the quarter, down 1% from the year-ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $24 million in the first quarter versus $26 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower sales in gross margins, partially offset by lower A&P and SG&A expenses. In the Commercial segment, net sales were $843 million or 2% below the prior year quarter, driven by the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures. Lamb Weston had a very solid quarter as net sales increased 4% versus the prior year quarter. The commercial segment's adjusted operating profit was $148 million versus $112 million in the year-ago quarter. This strong increase was driven primarily by the net sales growth and margin expansion in our Lamb Weston business, partially offset by the profit decline resulting from the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures during the quarter. We realized proceeds of $486 million from these divestitures and recognized an aggregate book gain of approximately $198 million. We expect to utilize the capital loss tax asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to these divestitures. In addition to the segment information, I will also note the following matters related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $24 million for the current quarter and $37 million in the year-ago period. The decline principally reflects lower profits from our Ardent Mills joint venture. Adjusted corporate expenses were $38 million in the fiscal quarter versus $66 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts, along with lower costs related to the timing of certain expenses that will come later in the fiscal year. Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $69 million, down 18% from the prior year quarter. Most of this decline was due to the timing of expense that will be incurred later in the fiscal year. Despite this lower spend, total gross rating points for our A&P investments were up 7% for the first quarter versus a year ago, reflecting improved efficiency. For the first quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $11 million and operating profit by $4 million versus the year-ago quarter. Moving on to our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making very good progress and expect to realize the remainder of our $200 million of SG&A savings over the next two years as planned. While we saw significant benefits from SG&A savings in the first quarter, I would point out that some of this benefit was due to the timing of certain expenses moving to later in the fiscal year. We estimate that the benefit from timing for SG&A was $25 million to $30 million in the first quarter. I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter. We had $0.34 per diluted share of net expense related to impairment charges. Approximately $140 million pretax relates to impairment of goodwill and approximately $24 million pretax relates to impairment of intangible brand assets, both related to our Canadian business. The charges are principally the result of several factors. First, the change in our reporting segments now requires us to evaluate goodwill at a lower level. In the past, under the previous reporting segments, we were only required to evaluate goodwill at the total International business level. We are now required to evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit within the International segment. Second, while the performance of our International business has been steady over the last several years on a constant currency basis, the significant weakening of the Canadian dollar has negatively impacted the value of the Canadian business on a U.S. dollar basis, which is used for the goodwill analysis. Finally, the brand impairment reflects both the unfavorable foreign exchange movements as well as some weaker top line trends in this portion of the business. In addition to the impairment charges, we recognized $0.17 per diluted share of net gain from the sale of the JM Swank and Spicetec businesses. We also recognized $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. And finally, we recognized approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net benefit from favorable adjustments to state tax assets. Moving on to cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $795 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the first quarter were $337 million versus $64 million in the year-ago quarter. This significant increase is due to the improved operating earnings in the current quarter and higher-than-normal income tax payments in the year-ago quarter. For the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $117 million versus $102 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter due to the paydown of debt during the past 12 months. For the quarter, we paid down approximately $554 million of long-term debt, and dividends for this fiscal quarter were $110 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $86 million, and we had approximately $46 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter. We continue to remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments. Lastly, our estimated effective tax rate for income from operations remains at 33.5% for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. The first quarter reported tax rate was higher primarily from the tax impacts of the noncash impairment charge and the gain on the sale of JM Swank and Spicetec. As we have noted in the release, we are not providing any comments on our outlook today. Instead, we will provide more information on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and the long-term algorithm for both ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston at our upcoming Investor Days. We are excited about the opportunities to create value for both of these companies. This concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I, along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session.\\nAndrew Lazar: Just two questions on gross margin, if I could. In the quarter, gross margins expanded about 200 basis points and recognizing pricing and trade spend discipline and some input costs favorability were some key drivers, I guess, was any of this due to maybe some supply chain initiatives that may have been taken but not maybe yet talked too publicly? Or is more of that on-the-come, so to speak? And I then I've just got a follow-up.\\nSean Connolly: Well, we'll talk quite extensively, Andrew, about our plans with supply chain when we get to Investor Day. But on gross margin, obviously, there are a number of different things that are contributing to the gains we are seeing and the gain -- the size of the gains do vary quarter-to-quarter. But the important fact is that, over the past two years, we've made tremendous progress at gross margin and operating margin, and you saw that again this quarter. Quarter-to-quarter, the progress may vary due to a number of factors, but what I'm focused on is that we continue to move the centerline of our profitability north over time, while reducing the standard deviation around that centerline. On supply chain, look, first of all, clearly, the overall goal of our collective efforts is value and margin maximization. And supply chain productivity programs have always been, and will continue to be, an important component of that. And as Dave Biegger will share at our upcoming ConAgra Brands Investor Day, strong productivity has been a legacy strength at ConAgra, and you saw some of that also this quarter. We do have a strong track record of continuous improvement in terms of network optimization, procurement, T&W, et cetera, and now that we're upgrading our volume base and reducing low-margin business, we are providing a better foundation to build off of, as we plan for future margin accretive innovation. And Dave has obviously brought a fresh perspective around how to sustain that strong historic supply chain performance and build on it even further, and he'll share those views in a few weeks.\\nAndrew Lazar: Got it. And that leads into my next one, which is based on some of the filings of Form 10s and such, it shows that ConAgra Brands will have a or does have a gross margin that is certainly substantially -- despite the progress, right, substantially lower than the large cap peer group. And I guess, I'm just curious, and I know you'll talk more about this in couple weeks, but is there any, I guess -- or how much of that gap, let's say, with the group do you see as maybe structural? Or any reason that this gap, I guess, can't be significantly narrowed over time? And is it something we'll hear more about perhaps at the Investor Day?\\nSean Connolly: Yes, it certainly will be, and if you picked up on one of the comments I made, Andrew, in my prepared remarks, if you look at our branded businesses in the U.S. as an example, you've seen margin improvement of about 700 basis points versus the same quarter two years ago. So clearly, we believe and we demonstrated that we can do the things necessary to expand those margins and by no means do we think our work is done. We will continue to chip away at that, and we'll do it using a number of different factors. And we talked about those factors but, hopefully, investors are getting a sense of how relentless we are in terms of pursuing margin expansion.\\nOperator: And we'll take a question now from David Driscoll with Citigroup.\\nDavid Driscoll: I wanted to ask just a little reconciliation on the quarter itself. So the timing issue was, I think, you said $30 million, so that's something like $0.05, and then the lower tax rate was maybe worth another $0.04. So is it correct that maybe if you think about this quarter, let's say, a $0.54, it's still a very solid beat over your original guidance, but those two other effects are notable. Is that -- do I have those correct?\\nDave Marberger: Yes. That's correct on the $30 million, David, with the SG&A and the tax rate is actually higher because of the impacts of the sale and the impairment.\\nDavid Driscoll: Sorry, versus the estimates that were going into the quarter is what I'm getting at for how we were modeling this. But okay, fine. And then as you look forward here, the -- is there any comments that you can give us on dyssynergies? Really, Sean, your comments are so very positive, but I always wonder if when breaking these things up, isn't there just fundamentally a dyssynergy number that's got to be overcome? And would just appreciate, I know this is maybe in advance of the big Analyst Day, but is there anything you can do to help us because we've got to put numbers out today for the forward forecast and would appreciate any comments on the dyssynergy computations.\\nSean Connolly: David, the strategy that we've been undertaking to transform this portfolio, we've been at it now for a while, and we have anticipated that you will have some things that flow back against you. It's one of the reasons why we moved so aggressively on the $300 million efficiency program right out of the gate is because we wanted to stay out ahead of this stuff. Similarly, it's the same reason our supply chain team is aggressively trying to get out ahead of any absorption benefits that we might lose when we pull back on volume. So we try to look around corners. We try to anticipate it and then we try to stay ahead of it. So with respect to ConAgra Brands, sure, there will be some modest stranded as we go ahead and step through these things, but that's part of the reason why you see us getting so aggressive on costs. Lamb is a standalone company, and you'll see the details on that in the Form-10. And obviously when you set up a standalone company, you're going to incur some unique costs for doing that but obviously, we strongly believe the benefit of having Lamb as an independent pure-play company with its great performance and growth prospects is really the story there. That's a terrific equity, and we can't wait to tell investors about the story in a few weeks.\\nOperator: We'll take a question now from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.\\nRob Moskow: Sean, I was -- in your prepared remarks, you said a lot about trying to get away from the highly priced sensitive consumer by walking away from a lot of these promotional programs, and I think that makes a lot of sense. I think one of the challenges you might have at the Analyst Day is, the perception of the portfolio of ConAgra is that a lot of the brands are targeted towards price-sensitive consumers that they are value brands. In your work on those brands, have you found kind of like a segmentation within those consumers that X percent are really price-sensitive for Chef, for example, but Y percent are very loyal. And do you have any insight for us on that that could help us?\\nSean Connolly: Yes, I'll make a brief comment, Rob, and then I'll turn it over to Tom McGough to add some color. But when we're talking about these incredibly, what I'll call, price-obsessed consumers who really only buy on prices, it's not a large percentage of the user base. I mean, there is plenty -- way more brand loyal users in the user base in brands like Banquet. The issue is catering to that small group that is super price-sensitive has an unwanted effect on the balance of the business. So we've got terrific brands. And keep in mind, you've got millions and millions and millions of households out there that make $50,000 a year that need good value and -- but they are incredibly brand loyal households as well. Tom, you want to add anything to that?\\nTom McGough: Sure. What I'd add is, we will provide data that splits our volume base across loyals and switchers, and the vast majority of our consumer base are those consumers that are loyal that buy their purchases based on the strength, the benefit, the features of our products. I think what Sean highlighted is that, by focusing on incremental volume to trade promotion, we're subsidizing the purchases of those people that would normally buy us at full retail price. And our focus on trade is trying to improve the ROI on those merchandising events. So at the end of the day, we will have a stronger consumer base with a higher percentage of loyal consumers, and we will drive margin improvement through the trade productivity that we will invest in those attributes that those consumers are looking for over time.\\nOperator: Ken Goldman with JPMorgan has our next question.\\nKen Goldman: In looking at the SG&A reduction, I know you talked about how some of it was temporary. I'm trying to get a sense though of how much of the remainder of that, right, is still the majority of that reduction that's not being deferred to later in the year, we can think of as maybe permanent. So maybe could you help us break out some of the drivers of that reduction, may be roughly bucket headcount reductions versus A&P savings, things like that? And I guess, as a carload to that, in terms of the amount that was pushed out of 1Q, I think you said $25 million to $30 million, could we model all of that being in 2Q? Or should we spread that throughout the year, as we look ahead?\\nSean Connolly: First of all, Ken, I'll start, and Dave, if you want to add any color, go right ahead. The SG&A program that we've been focused on is a $200 million program, that is not an A&P program. That is a structural SG&A program. And we are, obviously, making great progress against our $200 million goal. Yes, we are tracking a bit of schedule but also some of what you are seeing, as Dave mentioned, is timing. And we're going to get into our outlook in terms of how it will flow going forward in a few weeks when we get to our Investor Day for ConAgra Brands. But the way I'd think about SG&A or for that matter, any inefficiency opportunities, we got our targets, we're making good progress on our targets, and we'll always continue to look for more pockets of inefficiency because it just gives us more fuel for growth.\\nDave Marberger: And Ken, let me call on that.\\nKen Goldman: Okay.\\nDave Marberger: Just so if you look at SG&A and you have to work through all the adjusted items, right, so if you look at the total SG&A, if you look year-on-year, we're down about $75 million for the quarter. And as I said in my remarks, about $30 million of that is really a timing that will come in, in later quarter. So that's where -- $40 million to $45 million is really the incremental kind of run rate, if you will, for the quarter for that. As you know, we started the savings in fiscal '16 really in the Q3 and 4, so Q2 will be another big incremental quarter, and then it'll start to wrap in the second half of this year where the increases will be less. But by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be 85% to 90% complete in terms of the total $200 million reduction plan.\\nKen Goldman: Okay, that's helpful, Dave. Quick follow-up, if I can. On Lamb Weston, you decided to load it up with a decent amount of leverage. Is that the natural result of wanting ConAgra Brands to have a squeaky clean balance sheet, maybe for M&A? And I'm a little confused about the decision to spin it off without a permanent CFO in place, it's a little unusual. That's not about anyone in particular, I like John, I'm just not sure how much confidence investors are going to have in whatever path is, I guess, outlined at the Analyst Day given that there is a new CFO coming in a few months later. So maybe you could help us understand the decision-making there?\\nSean Connolly: Yes. Let me try to be helpful there, Ken. With respect, first of all, to the Lamb leverage, the ConAgra Board has been squarely focused on how to maximize total value, and this is top of mind when thinking about decisions like leverage. And as you'll see at Lamb's Investor Day in a couple of weeks, it is an extremely strong business with excellent cash flows, and we are quite confident that it will continue to thrive. Beyond that, we're going to hold off until the Investor Day to get into details on things like capital priorities. With respect to the Lamb CFO, I think the big picture here that I don't want investors to lose is, we are making excellent progress rounding out the Lamb management team. You're going to learn more about these folks here in short order as well as populating the Board with seasoned veterans that are really going to help this company get off, I believe, to a flying start. We are very far along in terms of the CFO search process. I don't want to get into the details of that process or our motives publicly for obvious reasons, but with the Investor Day just a couple of weeks away, we are very fortunate to have John Gehring help us get things launched. And for those of you who weren't tracking with Ken's comments, you might have missed the -- in this morning's announcement that John will be the Interim CFO here over the course of the next couple of months, as we stand Lamb up. But again, we'll have more to talk about on our permanent CFO in the not-so-distant future.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bank of America's Bryan Spillane.\\nBryan Spillane: Just two quick ones for me. First, and I might have missed this, but the effective tax rate in the quarter once you've excluded all of the one-time items, just -- what's the clean sort of effective tax rate?\\nDave Marberger: The clean effective tax rate, 33.5%.\\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then the second one for you, Sean, is just -- as you're going through this process of reducing the -- your promotional activity and taking that the volume hit that comes with that, velocity starts to slow. And sometimes when velocity slows, it starts to compound on itself. So can you talk a little bit about just what you are doing? What the circuit breakers are just to make sure you don't get yourself into a situation where you've got the sort of the volume base right but it's hard to restart some velocity because of where the momentum is? And I guess, related to that, just could you confirm, it sounds like with advertising and marketing may be down in the quarter, you're still going through this process of resetting volume at a time where there's going to -- you're not really maybe necessarily fully supporting the brands with the advertising you tend to?\\nSean Connolly: All right. There's a lot there. Let me try to hit the key points there. First of all, what we're doing it's a bit like if any of you have ever remodeled a house, it's a bit like that. The process is a bit messy, but if you want to get to the desired outcome, you got to go through the process. And this is a transformation that we're undertaking here, and our approach is to value profitable growth, not any growth but we do keep a close eye on markers to make sure that the business is in control and doing what we plan. So as an example, if you get into the scanner data and you peel it back, you'll see obvious things that you should expect such as baseline trends being significantly different from promoted trends. And then furthermore, if you get into baseline velocities, you will see that our baseline velocities are, in fact, quite stable. You will see TPDs going back, but you'll see TPDs going back because we, along with being very focused on price, have infused into the marketplace over a number of years a long tail of low-margin, nonproductive SKUs of multiple sizes that we are -- frankly, they had no value, so we've to get them out. Our customers appreciate that. It's part of being good category managers. And then the key is to continue to support the items that are moving at strong velocities, contemporizing them, refreshing them and then adding to them with new innovation and then ultimately proper marketing support. Now with respect to your question of marketing support in the quarter, yes, A&P was down. Some of that is timing because we do want to align our A&P spend with planned in-market actions like innovation launches and key promotions, things like that. So some of its timing, but some of it is just good discipline and getting rid of nonworking or attempted working marketing that just, frankly, wasn't. And that is you see -- and also buying better. Your GRPs were up 7% in the quarter on a fewer dollars, so the impact was reasonably respectable. And I think it's important that we keep that kind of support out there while we're taking some of these promotion items, so we can really evolve the conversation with our consumer to be about something other than price and that's we're doing. We'll talk about this quite extensively along with things like portfolio segmentation strategy in a few weeks at our Investor Day.\\nOperator: We'll move now to Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\\nAlexia Howard: Two questions. Firstly, on the volume declines. You talked a lot about how a lot of that's deliberate given the actions that you're taken to improve the quality of revenues. Are you able to tell us if you haven't taken those actions, what the underlying volume decline would have been? And further, are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of overall volumes are associated with these consumer segments that you're really not that interested in? So volume is the first one. The second question is we're hearing from a number of places that retailers, particularly large retailers, are beginning to demand more reinvestment in price and promotional activity, which seems to be the opposite direction from where you're going. How do think that's going to play out in 2017? And are you confident that you can sort of hold your ground without losing distribution?\\nSean Connolly: Sure. Alexia, I'll take the second one first. On the notion that some retailers may be asking for more promotion, quite frankly, that tends to vary fairly meaningfully by category depending upon what a retailer's objectives are with particular categories. In general, our customers are asking us for growth and innovation. They want to see us evolve our brand so that we're not competing on price, so that we're competing on quality measures. You see customers giving more and more real state to these challenger brands that have modern food attributes like natural, organic, premium. These are the things that consumers are demanding, and this is what many of our retailers in our categories are prioritizing. And it's precisely why we're evolving the businesses that we own as well as adding new businesses that are complementarity like Frontera, Blake's and others like that. With respect to our volume piece, let's go back to the point in my prepared remarks, I think, that really describes it best. This is a -- our actions are broad-based but the volume decline, when you add it up, is incredibly concentrated. And in our case, it was in our six brands, each of which has its own story as to what we're doing and why we're doing it. But if you use Banquet as an example because that's the biggie, here's how to think about Banquet. The bottom line is locking a brand into a $1 price point for decade. It's just not a good business decision because it puts relentless pressure on margins and in turn, food quality. And at the same time, it retrains our Banquet loyalists to buy on deal. So the change was long overdue. And while the topline optics can be ugly until you wrap a year later, it's up over 300 basis points, the business and grows margin, which is excellent news. Now we've got to continue to support the business with levers other than price. And that's what we're going to do, and that's what our customers are counting on us to do.\\nOperator: We'll take a question now from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.\\nLubi Kutua: This is Lubi filling in for Akshay. First question is just on the consumer brands businesses. If you can comment on advertising expense this quarter, just trying to understand the different pieces of the -- setting the profit outperformance this quarter. So how much was -- advertising expenses were down during the quarter? And how should we think about that going forward?\\nSean Connolly: A&P was down in the quarter, as we talked. GRPs were up so impact was up, but we spent less money. We will move -- some of those dollars are moved into the remaining quarters for the balance of the year, as we talked. But it'll -- a piece of it was timing and a piece of it was just improved efficiency.\\nOperator: We'll move now to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank.\\nMario Contreras: Sean, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some good outperformance from the supply chain team in offsetting some of the over head absorption from the volume declines. Can you talk a little bit more specifically about how they're able to go about achieving that? And then related to that, how were the volume declines tracking versus your expectations going into the quarter?\\nSean Connolly: Yes. The supply chain team at ConAgra has been doing a great job for a long time. I don't know how much we've talked about the capabilities that we've had with investors, but we intend to do that in a few weeks. And we've had very strong gross productivity performance historically, and we're continuing to work to not only sustain that but to find new ways to build upon that, and we'll outline that here coming up in a few weeks for you. With respect to the volume overall, it's pretty consistent with what we expect. And if you just go back to our last couple of quarters, I've tried to be very transparent around not only our strategy, but the implications of our strategy and the notion that it's not always pretty to look at but it's important that we go through this if we're going to get to a different place. And -- but we feel like we're squarely on track.\\nOperator: We'll take a question now from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.\\nJonathan Feeney: Sean, a lot of what you've done had obviously made tremendous improvements to the value proposition. And I'm wondering, how much of -- you talked about these, your price seeking, your value only consumers, how much of this is a change in the consumers, say, over the past three or four years where maybe the strategies that were good four years ago are less relevant today? And how much of this is just you bringing a fresh set of eyes and a new methodology to the business? And I asked because maybe that -- those trends continue and it's actually maybe it's a little bit of -- it's a great time for -- I shouldn't say it's a great time, it's a much improved time for lower and middle income consumers right now with falling gas prices and wage gains. And I wonder if maybe just that improvement is helping you realize this pricing and maybe better-than-expected results?\\nSean Connolly: The way I'd think about it, John, is when the consumer looks at a brand, the brand is going to communicate something to them. For a long time, our brands communicated deal. We are a deal brand and interestingly, even low income consumers are very interested in a brand communicating with them on other means. For example, there were -- there was a period of time in our past where our PAM business was heavily promoted and the only trick in the book that we turned to was dealing. But if you look at consumer trends in oil over the last few years, you see that the oils have changed, it's moved to things like olive oil, things like coconut oil. So instead of competing on PAM on price attributes, we've evolved the PAM business, and we've got olive oil PAM. We've got coconut oil PAM. These are relevant modern-day attributes that changed the discussion with the consumer to be about something that they value and they will pay more for and not about deep discounting. That's just one example. We'll talk about more examples at our Investor Day, but that's exactly what we need to do to get really the loyalty up on our business, get our prices up and build our overall brand strength to make it as modern as it can be.\\nOperator: Our final question today will come from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.\\nMichael Walsh: It's actually Michael Walsh filling in for Todd. Sean and Dave, you've been consistent in publicly stating your desire to retain an investment grade credit rating. And earlier, you mentioned that as well. You also mentioned debt reduction, and I know ConAgra Brands will get a $675 million payment from Lamb Weston with the spin. You're going to lose a chunk of EBITDA. Can you just talk about how much debt reduction you expect going forward? And do you have any type of leverage target that you would manage your balance sheet to?\\nSean Connolly: Yes, thanks for the question. With respect to balance sheet questions, we're going to get into that in earnest in a few weeks at Investor Day. But with respect to ConAgra Brands, big picture as we've said and as you pointed out, as we intend to continue our commitment to being rated investment grade, we'll continue to a balanced capital allocation philosophy with strong dividend and a willingness to buy back shares and an appreciation for smart, value creating M&A. All of those things are fair game, which is not a departure from where we've been but rather very consistent. But we'll get into more details here on that in a few weeks.\\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Nystedt, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.\\nJohan Nystedt: Thank you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release. As always, we're available for discussions. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra.\\nOperator: This concludes today's ConAgra Foods First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.\",\n",

       "  'Operator\\nGreetings, and welcome to the TDS and U.S. Cellular First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jane McCahon, Senior Vice President, Corporate Relations at TDS. Thank you, Ms. McCahon, please begin.\\nJane McCahon\\nThank you, Melissa [ph] and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want to make you all aware of the presentation we prepared to accompany our comments this morning, which you\\'ll find on the Investor Relations sections of the TDS and U.S. Cellular websites.\\nWith me today and offering prepared comments are from U.S. Cellular, Ken Meyers, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Gockley, Vice President, Legal and Regulatory Affairs; from TDS Telecom, Vicki Villacrez, Vice President Finance and CFO.\\nThis call is being simultaneously webcast on the TDS and U.S. Cellular Investor Relations websites. Please see the websites for slides referred to on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. As a reminder, we provide guidance for both operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. For TDS Telecom, these are basically the same number. For U.S. Cellular, however, the adjusted EBITDA measure includes imputed interest income from EIP and significant contributions from our partnership, which we want to continue to highlight for investors.\\nThe information set forth in the presentation and discussed during this call contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Please review the Safe Harbor paragraph in our press releases and the extended version in our SEC filings.\\nTo update you on capital allocation in the quarter, TDS paid $60 million in dividend and repurchased $2.5 million of its shares, a modest number, although we did not acquire any cable assets in the quarter. As mentioned on the year-end call, U.S. Cellular filed a short form application for the upcoming auction for 600 megahertz spectrum known as Auction 1000. As the anti-collusion rules are now in effect, we are prohibited from speaking about it further, so we will not be entertaining any of the questions related to spectrum.\\nShortly after we released our earnings and before the call, TDS and U.S. Cellular filed their SEC forms 8-K, including today\\'s press releases and their Form 10-Qs. Later this month and prior to our annual meetings, we plan to be on the road in New York and Boston. Our annual meetings are in those week of May 23rd and we will be webcasting those for your convenience.\\nAlso keep in mind that TDS has an open door policy. So if you\\'re in the Chicago area and would like to meet with members of management, the IR team will try to accommodate you, calendar’s permitting.\\nNow, I\\'ll turn the call over to Ken Meyers.\\nKen Meyers\\nGood morning. Turning to Slide 4, I\\'m pleased with our start for the year. Subscriber growth on data centric devices showed a nice pickup. Churn remained low, actually improved, and expense control remained tight. Cash flow was down slightly, as anticipated in our original guidance, showing the impact of the pickup in growth year-over-year as well as industry-wide pricing tension.\\nLet\\'s start by reviewing customer growth, our top priority. It was our objective to get the year off to a strong start, as those customers we had now contribute to a performance all year long and we saw some solid performance in the quarter. All handset gross adds were flat year-over-year, smartphone adds increased almost 4% and connected devices, primarily tablets, were up 21%. Sales of feature phones continued to decline. Smartphones represented 93% of all postpaid handset gross adds this quarter, up 400 basis points from a year ago.\\nGiven the implications of the decline in switching activity across the industry, we are working to refine our value proposition and increase awareness of both our network quality, including our 4G coverage, and the availability of Apple and other iconic devices. It is still very encouraging that 21% of our gross adds are previous customers coming back to us.\\nLast quarter I talked about a few initiatives we had underway to drive customer growth in 2016, let me expand a little on one in particular. We have intensified our focus on serving the small and medium sized business customers, including local and regional government entities. This is an underpenetrated market for us, and yet it is one perfect for us given our local positioning. In the first quarter, we saw gross adds from our S&D [ph] segment up 48%, albeit off a relatively small base but the point is we are definitely making progress in this area.\\nAlso, I am particularly encouraged by our continuous improvement in churn and especially postpaid churn. Smartphone net adds were just over 20,000 in the quarter, compared to about 3,000 a year ago. About 25% of that increase is due to the pickup in gross adds I mentioned earlier, and the other three quarters of the pickup is due to improved churn. We all know churn is usually an outcome of something gone wrong. So we stay very close to our customers. We are constantly measuring customer engagement and adjusting our business practices and services to better meet their needs.\\nOur survey show this strategy is working as customer engagement is moving in the right direction, giving me reason for optimism about our ability to drive handset churn even lower in the future. To strengthen alignment around this customer-focused strategy, we’ve actually made customer engagement a company-wide measurement for success. So in sum, net postpaid customer additions totaled 45,000, up significantly over the 9,000 postpaid net adds generated last year, driven by smartphones and tablets.\\nOur customers overall satisfaction is largely influenced by our network strategy. Last year, we completed our deployment of 4G LTE. It now reaches 99% of all of our postpaid customers, providing an excellent network experience in our suburban and rural markets. Additionally, with multiple 4G roaming agreements now in place, our customers can receive better data experiences as they travel too. Finally, our network team is working toward our first commercial deployment of VoLTE, voice over LTE, early next year.\\nOur device portfolio remains very competitive and we\\'ve seen some strong performance from the new Samsung Galaxy S7. Also, we\\'ve introduced expanded offerings on equipment installment plans which have been well received by our customers, as you can see with the take rate of 69% of postpaid sales to end users in the quarter.\\nGrowing our customer base is not enough, however, we must also capture additional revenue growth. The improvement in our smartphone portfolio and our expanded 4G network has steadily increased postpaid smartphone penetration which now stands at 75% of the postpaid handset base. Although notable progress has been made, we still have an opportunity to drive additional revenue by converting more of our feature phone users to smartphone users.\\nOur shared connect data plans allow us to capitalize on the increasing data consumption, so long as competitive pricing doesn\\'t give away all of that future growth opportunity. Connected devices provide an opportunity to meet the expanding customer needs, while driving store traffic, increasing data usage and revenue per account. At the same time, the more we meet multiple customer needs, the more important our collective services become to our customers and the lower risk we face of customer churn.\\nAs I discussed in February, another strategic priority for 2016 is to reduce unit cost. As has been reported by others in the industry, we are seeing our customers holding on to their devices longer, which resulted in a 7.6% upgrade rate for the quarter. While this is low by historic standards, it is a slight increase from the most recent trend, impacted I believe by the successful launch of the Galaxy S7 to our customer base, which owned a good number of earlier Samsung models.\\nImproved pricing on subsidized handset combined with the EIP higher take rate resulted in a 41% decline in loss on equipment per unit. Another example of our progress in this area would be 11% reduction in general and administrative expenses per average customer and a 7% reduction in systems operation expense per average customer.\\nIn summary, we are off to a solid start, not a great start, not yet reaching aspirational levels but a solid start with improved customer results leading the way.\\nNow let me turn the phone call over to Steve Campbell. Steve?\\nSteve Campbell\\nThank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. I\\'ll begin with a few additional comments on customer results which are shown on Slide 5 of the presentation. As Ken already mentioned, we grew our customer base during the first quarter with 45,000 postpaid net additions, a significant increase from 9,000 net additions a year ago. The growth was driven by positive results in both gross additions, which increased 8% year-over-year to 215,000 in postpaid churn which improved again this quarter to 1.28% compared to 1.48% a year ago.\\nSimilar to the past few quarters, the growth in postpaid net additions was driven by data centric devices like smartphones and connected devices. Together, they accounted for 70,000 net additions. Net handset additions were negative 5000, a significant improvement from negative 31,000 in the prior year, driven by reduced churn. And although total handset net additions were negative 5,000, as Ken discussed earlier, smartphone net additions were positive 20,000, up from only 3,000 a year ago. On top of that, feature phone customers continued to upgrade to smartphones, with the result that total smartphone users increased by 63,000 during the quarter.\\nIn the prepaid category, we had 12,000 net additions, the same level as a year ago. As shown on Slide 6, smartphones represented 92% of total handset sold this quarter, increasing smartphone penetration to 75% of our basic postpaid handset customers, up from 67% a year ago. Based on the levels of smartphone penetration achieved by other carriers, we believe that we still have opportunity to upgrade more of our remaining feature phone customers to smartphones and drive additional data usage revenues.\\nAbout 7.6% of our postpaid customers upgraded their devices this quarter, compared to 6.6% a year ago. This quarter\\'s activity was influenced by the timing of new device launches. Compared to the fourth quarter, which is normally higher due to seasonal activity, this quarter\\'s upgrade rate was down by about 90 basis points.\\nThe next slide shows the longer-term trend in our postpaid churn rate, which is at a historically low level. Postpaid churn has steadily decreased from its peak of 2.29% in the first quarter 2014 to 1.28% for the first quarter of this year.\\nNow let\\'s talk about our financial results. Total operating revenues for the first quarter were $958 million, about the same as last year\\'s $965 million. Service revenues were $760 million, down $68 million or 8% from last year, largely reflecting lower plan pricing due to industry competition and the continued migration to the unsubsidized pricing, meaning the planned discounts that accompany equipment installment plans sales and activations of customer owned equipment. The impact of lower plan pricing was partially offset by the growth in our customer base.\\nEquipment sales revenues grew 45% to $198 million, driven by higher equipment installment plans sales. The percentage of postpaid device sales on installment plans increased to 69% in the first quarter, compared to 53% in the fourth quarter and 41% a year ago. We expect the installment plan take rate to continue to increase over the remainder of this year.\\nPostpaid ARPU, shown on the next slide, was $48.13 for the first quarter, down 12% year-over-year due to price competition and continued migration to unsubsidized pricing. However, this metric excludes equipment installment plan billings to customers. The average billings per user, which includes those billings and provides a better representation of the total amount being collected from customers every month, shows a decrease of 4% year-over-year which is more indicative of the impacts of price competition and the growth in connected devices, which on a per device basis bring lower revenue.\\nThe average revenue per account benefits from the increase in connections per account from 2.47 a year ago to 2.62. For the first quarter, it was $125.36, down 7% year-over-year. But when equipment installment plan billings are included, average billings per account actually increased by 1% year-over-year.\\nWe expect that there will be continuing downward pressure on service revenues as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized pricing, and our equipment sales revenues will continue to grow as the take rate for equipment installment plans increases. Another note is that as different equipment installment plan terms are offered under our accounting practices, the amount of revenue recognized in the period of sale could be affected.\\nOperating cash flow for the quarter, shown next, was in line with our expectations. The success achieved in increasing the level of net additions impacted operating cash flow as expected, when we discussed our annual guidance with you on the year-end call. Therefore when looking at operating cash flow and the year-over-year comparison, remember that this year\\'s number includes the cost of the incremental customer growth that we achieved. Retail gross additions increased by 6% and retail net additions increased from 21,000 to 57,000.\\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $157 million compared to $167 million a year ago. The decrease was largely due to lower revenues as I discussed earlier. Total cash expenses were essentially flat year-over-year with an increase in the cost of equipment sold, offset by reductions in other categories.\\nAdjusted EBITDA shown next incorporates the earnings from our equity method partnerships along with the interest in dividend income, which consist mainly of imputed interest income from equipment installment plans. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $206 million compared to $209 million a year ago.\\nEarnings from unconsolidated entities were $35 million. This included $19 million from the LA partnership, which was relatively flat year-over-year. As we expected, the LA partnership did not make cash distribution in the first quarter. At this time, the amount and timing of future cash distributions are uncertain.\\nNext, I want to cover our guidance for 2016, which is shown on Slide 12 of the presentation. For comparison, we\\'re showing our 2015 results, both as reported and excluding the impact of the termination of the rewards program. The current estimates are unchanged from those provided in February.\\nIn summary, for total operating revenues, we expect a range of approximately $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This reflects our expectation for modest customer growth, additional demand for data and a continued migration through equipment installment plans along with a very competitive pricing environment. For operating cash flow, we expect a range of $525 million to $650 million. The estimate for operating cash flow flows through to the estimated range for adjusted EBITDA which is $725 million to $850 million.\\nTo the extent that we achieve a lower level of customer growth than currently estimated, we would expect results to be in the upper portions of these ranges. On the other hand, to the extent that we are successful on attracting a higher level of customer growth than currently estimated or if the pricing environment worsens, we would expect results to be in the lower portions of the ranges.\\nCapital expenditures are expected to be about $500 million. This lower level of spending compared to 2015 reflects the completion of our 4G LTE deployment. On the other hand, it includes spending to meet higher data demand and to prepare for the initial commercial launch of VoLTE.\\nFinally, I want to make just a couple of comments about U.S. Cellular\\'s cash flows and liquidity. Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter were $163 million, while cash flows used for investing and financing activities totaled $106 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and equivalents of $57 million. As of March 31st, cash and equivalents totaled $772 million. In addition to these existing balances, U.S. Cellular had $202 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility.\\nWe believe that these resources are sufficient to meet our normal operating investment and other debt service requirements for the remainder of this year. However, these resources may not be adequate to fund all future expenditures that we could potentially elect to make, such as purchases of spectrum licenses in the FCC auctions or other acquisitions, and it may be necessary from time to time to increase the size of the existing revolving credit facility, to issue new debt or to obtain other forms of financing in order to fund those expenditures. In that event, accounts receivable under equipment installment plans represent a potential source of financing. At March 31st, the balance of those receivable was $391 million.\\nNow, John Gockley, the company\\'s Vice President, Legal and Regulatory Affairs will provide a brief update on some of our activities in that arena. John?\\nJohn Gockley\\nThank you, Steve and good morning.\\nTurning to Slide 13, this is proving to be a very active year on a regulatory front. Besides this being an election year, the Chairman of the FCC has made it known that he intends \"to run to the finish line\". There are a number of proceedings and issues currently in play which are of keen interest to us and which show signs of being resolved this year.\\nFirst, just last week, the FCC announced at its open meeting, the issuance of a notice of proposed rule-making, proposing a novel approach to the long-standing issue of special access pricing in markets with limited competitive alternatives. The FCC is now proposing to look at the issue on a technologically neutral basis and to examine all providers of both traditional special access circuits and Ethernet facilities and not just incumbent telecos.\\nThe text of the NPRM was released jointly here this week and we are still in the process of reviewing it. We fully expect to be actively involved in those proceedings. The issue of special access pricing has been an open issue at the FCC for way too long, and we view the issuance of this NPRM as a positive development to resolving this issue once and for all. Ethernet backhaul still remains a substantial expense to us and will continue to remain so as consumers continue to consume more and more data services.\\nThe FCC has also launched a proceeding to address the adoption of privacy rules for data services. This proceeding is a logical outgrowth of the decision to re-regulate broadband access as a tied on to common carrier service last year. This is a complicated proceeding with the notice of proposed rule-making keying up over 500 questions or comments. We\\'ve operated under the existing CPNI rules for many years now and we are fully committed to protecting the privacy of our customers.\\nWe ask only of this proceeding that the commission apply a balanced approach that protects customers without adopting onerous operational requirements, which are out of sync with the requirements imposed on other non-common carrier companies who have access in many cases to even more customer data than we do. Of course, we along with the rest of the industry are waiting with great interest to see what the DC Court of Appeals has to say about the FCC\\'s open internal rules, which, depending on what the court does, may have a profound impact on this proceeding.\\nThe FCC recently released its Lifeline Reform Order which will transition the Lifeline program from supporting voice communications to supporting broadband access service over multiple years. Our Lifeline portfolio was a very small part of our business and other than some operational issues associated with the transition, we think that this conversion will have a very little impact on our business. We are currently exploring whether our Lifeline discount apply to data services as contemplated by this order will provide the company with a meaningful opportunity.\\nWe are, however, dubious whether the Lifeline discount of only $9.25 will have much effect on data service subscribership by low income Americans. We would have liked to have seen the FCC entertain a higher discount amount, given that the goal of the program is to drive broadband access subscribership by the most economically challenged Americans higher.\\nLastly is the issue of the future of the Universal Service high cost program, the wireless broadband deployment in rural, unserved and underserved areas of this country. This remains an important issue for the company and for our customers living in rural America. This past February, our Chairman Ted Carlson testified before the Senate Congress Committee about the continuing need for government support for wireless broadband deployment in rural regions and the need for better and more accurate data so that informed decisions could be made about where to deploy facilities and about how much support is necessary to bridge this digital divide.\\nOur Chairman also made note of the profound effect that 5G networks are likely to have on broadband access, and he suggested that funding decisions concerning USF needed to take into account the cost and complexity of bringing 5G networks to rural America. We think his message was very well received.\\nIn fact, recently through the leadership of Senator Joe Manchin, the Senate Congress Committee approved an amendment to the FCC Reauthorization Bill, instructing the FCC to conduct a feasibility study into ways to gather better and more accurate data about the state of wireless broadband deployment in the rural America. We think this proposed law has merit and clearly signals the FCC a concern of reaching important USF decisions based on incomplete data.\\nWe intend to continue to work with Congress and regulators in the design and implementation of a Universal Service Program that will meet our national goals to provide broadband access to rural and urban America alike.\\nVicki?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nThanks, John, and good morning everyone. TDS Telecom\\'s overall results for the first quarter were in line with our expectations. First Wireline revenues declined 2%, which was primarily due to the impacts of the divestitures we completed last year. Adjusting for these effects, Wireline revenues were nearly even with last year.\\nSecond, Cable revenues grew at 3% rate, reflecting growth in both residential and commercial broadband revenues. And third, HMS revenues grew 5%, due primarily to increased equipment sales but also includes growth in reoccurring service revenues.\\nCash expenses increased modestly across all three segments as we continue to position for growth. As a result, adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis declined 4% year-over-year to 76 million.\\nBeginning with Wireline on Slide 16, our investments on our network in efforts to make higher speed options available to customers continue to drive growth in IPTV connections. We also continued to see increases in the take rate on 10 megabits and higher broadband products. In the first quarter, we rolled out one new IPTV market. We\\'ve now launched TDS TV in 28 markets and enabled 174,000 service addresses for IPTV service.\\nWe are completing our planned fiber build to reach approximately 21% of our ILEC service addresses. And when combined with copper service, our IPTV enabled markets cover approximately 25% of our service addresses. For the reminder of the year, we will focus on driving IPTV high-speed broadband bundle in these markets.\\nTo further strengthen our broadband offerings, we are deploying bonding technology to an additional one-third of our ILEC service addresses, to drive higher speeds in our middle tier ILEC copper markets. In our remaining markets, we are evaluating the FCC\\'s modified universal service funding mechanism to support broadband build out.\\nUnder this modified USF mechanism announced in March 30th, the FCC is providing greater return carriers with two paths to receive funds. The first path includes a voluntary model-based approach, which we could elect on a state-by-state level and includes a fixed amount of support for a 10-year period in exchange for meeting defined build out obligations for broadband services.\\nThe second path is based on existing rate of return mechanisms, from which we receive support today, but will carry substantial modifications going forward, including a reduction in the allowed rate of return, the elimination of support in competitive areas and defined build-out obligations. In general, we are pleased with many aspects of the order and are carefully evaluating our options under the two paths.\\nNow looking at the metrics from the bottom of the slide, IPTV connections grew 50%, adding 12,800 subscribers compared to the prior year. And we added 2,800 broadband connections excluding divestitures. We are offering a variety of speeds up to 1 gigabits service in all IPTV markets. The uptick on IPTV has grown steadily and is now at an average penetration rate of 28%.\\nIt is important to remember 97% of our IPTV customers take all three services, which results in a low churn rate and drove an increase in average revenue per connection up to $43.28 in the quarter.\\nReflecting both our fiber and bonded cooper deployments, residential broadband customers are continuing to choose higher speeds in our ILEC market, with 49% choosing speed of 10 megabits or greater and 18% choosing speed of 25 megabits or greater which also contribute to the higher ARPU.\\nLooking at Slide 17, Wireline results were mildly impacted by ILEC divestitures. While I\\'m going to give you the actual results as presented, on a same-store basis we were a bit stronger. Residential revenues increased 2% as growth in broadband and IPTV more than offset the decline in our legacy voice services. The year-over-year decrease in ILEC residential voice connections has held at about 3% over the past seven quarters excluding divestitures.\\nCommercial revenues decreased 4% and high margin wholesale revenues decreased 5% this quarter. On a combined basis, total Wireline revenues declined 2% to $173 million. Wireline cash expenses increased 2% as increases in employee related expenses and IPTV content cost outpaced the reduced cost of provisioning legacy services. As a result, Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased $5 million or 8%.\\nSlide 18, cable connections growth. Total cable connections grew 5% to 284,000. On the residential side connections increased, driven by 8% growth in broadband and a 23% growth in voice. This growth more than offset the continued declines in video connections. The residential broadband subscriber growth drove a 200 basis point increase in broadband penetration. While total commercial connections were flat, broadband connections grew 14%.\\nOn Slide 19, you can see total revenues increased for Cable 3% to $45 million, Residential revenues increased 1% as higher promotional offerings offset the connections growth. Commercial revenues increased 10%, primarily as a result of price increases through video. Cash expenses increased 6% as higher programming cost and property taxes were offset by cost synergies achieved from the acquisition synergies we are seeing. As a result Cable adjusted EBITDA remained relatively flat.\\nTurning to the HMS segment and speaking from both Slides 20 and 21, the HMS business remained focused on growing reoccurring service revenues. Our hosting service revenues grew 2% for the quarter. Last year we invested in building data center space and we are focused on selling across our portfolio of services, which will utilize available data center capacity and increase revenues without requiring significant capital investment in 2016.\\nEquipment sales improved $2 million due to the higher spending by existing customers. Cash expenses were up 2% compared to the same period in the prior year, which mainly reflects higher cost of itself to support equipment sales. Other operating expenses were down as reductions in employee expense has had a meaningful impact. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA increasing by $2 million.\\nWe have provide our guidance for 2016 on Slide 22, which is unchanged from the guidance we shared in February. I will remind you that these numbers do not include considerations for the impact of FCC USF reform order. Overall, we are pleased with the results of the Telecom\\'s first quarter and we\\'ll continue to update you on a successful execution of our strategic priorities throughout the year.\\nNow, I\\'ll turn the call back over Jane.\\nJane McCahon\\nThanks, Vicki. And operator, we\\'re ready to take questions. I\\'ll let folks know we have other people in the room, Kevin Hess, Telecom SVP responsible for Government and Regulatory Affairs; Doug Shuma, Corporate SVP of Finance and others are in the room with us. So, Melissa [ph], we\\'ll take our first question.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\\nRic Prentiss\\nThanks, good morning.\\nKen Meyers\\nHey, Ric.\\nJane McCahon\\nMorning, Ric.\\nRic Prentiss\\nHey, let\\'s start with U.S. Cellular, Ken, as we think about this quarter versus last year, last year the growth was not as significant, so on the short-term basis, EBITDA and operating cash flow did a little better. This quarter more investment for the long-term you\\'re seeing the growth, so what I\\'d like to kind of get at with the question is as you think about the guidance, what level of gross adds should we be expecting for that to hit the high end or the low end? Because obviously you\\'re seeing 15% growth -- or I\\'d say it was 8% growth in the gross adds on the quarter was significant compared to last year. I mean gross adds over the year were down 15% versus 14%.\\nKen Meyers\\nYes, Ric, that thing is exactly the one that we grappled with as we established guidance for the year. From a strategic standpoint, I want -- it is necessary for us to continue to grow the customer base, that is both by some of the marketing programs like I talked about in the SMB area, it\\'s about driving gross adds and it\\'s also about driving down churn. Both of those on the one end have cost involved with them, and so when we put together our guidance there, we talked about how we were going to use promotional activity that if it was successful, would manifest itself in operating expenses and higher adds. But because it was promotional, it wasn\\'t as successful. You\\'d have less expense, more cash flow but not the adds. The first quarter -- this is just what we wanted it to do. We got off to a nice fast start and our objective is to continue to build on that. Our objective is to continue to grow the base, which is why the cash flow guidance, as an example, is where we put it for the year. The most successful year will have us growing the base and continuing to invest cash flow and staying within the guide, which is why we reiterated it, and we\\'re reiterating it today, we aren\\'t changing it. So if the market turns soft, right, we will have less adds and we\\'ll just see more cash flow coming to the bottom line.\\nRic Prentiss\\nRight. So should we expect gross adds kind of at a similar year-over-year level, as I\\'m thinking of that, if you\\'re successful growing the business, it would be kind of similar to the first quarter in general?\\nKen Meyers\\nIt could be.\\nRic Prentiss\\nOkay, also you mentioned optimistic handset churn to go even lower, one item spread recently when they reported did start breaking out handset churn from other churn, so hopefully you can kind of continue to give us maybe that extra data point on what handset churn is. I assume there\\'s not much tablet churn in the current timeframe though?\\nKen Meyers\\nNot much, but in fact our handset churn is lower or better than tablet churn, but both of them are important products and we continue to see very good customer retention across all of the supply line. In fact, the one we haven\\'t talked about, prepaid actually showed some really nice improvement in churn year-over-year also.\\nRic Prentiss\\nOkay. And then EIP if I understood Steve\\'s comment right, you expect EIP to actually increase through the remainder of the year, what level of EIP do you think we could reach as we look at customers liking this type of plan?\\nKen Meyers\\nWell, we can look at what others have done and see rates meaningfully above where we\\'re running, but understand our marketing strategy is not to drive EIP for EIP sake but rather to make sure that we\\'ve got the right products and services in the market for our customers and to make sure that either one of them, or all of them rather, are profitable for the business. So customers that want a subsidized model, we want to make sure that we\\'ve got an offering that works for them as well as an EIP offering that works for those that want that. So it\\'s an outcome, it\\'s not a target. So I don\\'t sit there and say, gee, we want more or less of this. What we want is the right products in the marketplace for our customers. So could it go higher? It absolutely could. It did go up to 80%. We\\'ve seen that in other places, but that\\'s not a target, it’s an outcome.\\nRic Prentiss\\nOkay. And then finally, just one question, I swear, so the other piece of it clearly is upgrades, industry level upgrades where we\\'re fairly light this quarter. You touched on the Samsung Galaxy S7 was a bigger exposure to you, but as we think about your guidance and comparing it to the rest of the industry, where are your thoughts as far as what upgrade levels would look like this year?\\nKen Meyers\\nWhen you think about upgrade rates, and this quarter it\\'s about 7, 7.6% and that\\'s lower than the fourth quarter, lower than the third quarter, and it\\'s lower than the second quarter of last year. It was above first quarter of last year. And when we look at it year-over-year one of the, I think, drivers to that was the success around the Galaxy 7. If you think about our customer base, we lost customers in the past because we didn\\'t have an iPhone in the portfolio. And as a result, I think it\\'s the distribution of our customers, we have a customer base that likes Android and is very, very happy with the Samsung devices. And given where we\\'ve had successful launches in the past, first quarter, the five two years ago, are at the end of their two-year contract, and now with EIP last year rolling out and is in the upgrade twelve months, we had a base that was waiting for this and we had a very successful [indiscernible]. We are targeting a lower upgrade rate, but again, it\\'s about making sure the programs that we put in place work economically for us until we see -- we\\'re seeing nothing to suggest we\\'re going to be running higher all year, but it was successful first quarter with the Galaxy product.\\nRic Prentiss\\nGreat, thanks. I\\'ll see you guys later next week.\\nKen Meyers\\nOkay. Thanks.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.\\nPhil Cusick\\nHey, guys, thanks. I guess first on the Wireline side, can you talk about the HMS strategy. It seems like the growth isn\\'t coming through the other way that we\\'d hope. How is that strategy coming together?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nSure. This is Vicki. As you think about HMS, HMS is really still a very important part of our growth strategy. And as you know, we\\'ve been very focused on integrating our five businesses that we acquired and going through and standardizing the processes and systems and trying to drive that reoccurring revenue growth. I think we continue to make progress, but we still have more work to do. And as we see clear progress, we\\'ll begin to set more milestones on around that reoccurring revenue growth. We saw nice growth overall, 5%, but as you know we want that to be higher.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay. And on the Cable side, sort of the same question, should we look for revenue to be growing here or is the offsetting of subscribers and ARPU sort of trailing off?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nYou know, as we said in our guidance for 2016, we\\'re really focused on looking for mid-single digit revenue growth. And in the first quarter, I reported 3%. If you adjust for an accounting adjustment, it was really running about 4%. We are running heavy promotions that are driving that really strong growth that you saw in broadband connections, and we\\'ll continue to monitor that growth throughout the year. But yes, we’re looking for mid-single digit growth which is meeting our expectations.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay. One for Ken, I think a lot of people expect or sort of understand that revenue per user on the postpaid side will come down, but it was pretty violent this quarter, anything one-time in there that we should be thinking about?\\nKen Meyers\\nNo, nothing is violent, I think, here for us. In terms of when we launched the EIP offering combined with the impact of tablets, when you think about your mix, you get a lot of noise in that. When we look at revenue per account continuing to grow, and we\\'ve low pricing stuff in the industry too, but it\\'s really right in line where we\\'re kind of expecting it right now, Phil. No one-timers in there.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay. So that 48 is the right level and probably down from there as we continue the mix?\\nKen Meyers\\nI think that there is still, from a service revenue standpoint, the still risk is that EIP kind of take rate keeps bouncing around.\\nPhil Cusick\\nGot it. And can you give us an update on your wireless roaming, both inbound and outbound?\\nKen Meyers\\nYes, so we\\'ve got 4G agreements now in place with three out of the four larger entities. We\\'ve got it launched with one of them already and working with others. Roaming revenue itself is, I\\'d call it modest, with that moving around a lot down a little bit year-over-year because of the pricing agreement entered into last year but roaming cost actually down even more year-over-year. So still continuing to manage that business pretty effectively. And importantly, as I think about it, it\\'s the roll out of voice over LTE that would start to turn on next year, that turns that into a growth opportunity, because suddenly we’ll be able to serve customers from every carrier versus just the CDMA based carriers that we serve today.\\nPhil Cusick\\nGot it. Thanks guys.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\\nSimon Flannery\\nThank you very much. Looking at the ARPU on the postpaid side, obviously the EIP transition is impacting that, can you give us a sense of what the sort of average EIP customer is paying in terms of ARPU as we get a sense of how that transition is working? And then any updates on the M&A environment over on the TDS Telecom side? Thanks.\\nKen Meyers\\nSimon, it\\'s Ken. I don\\'t have in front of me something that\\'s look at average revenue just on EIP account, so we can follow up with you, but I don\\'t have that in the room right now.\\nSimon Flannery\\nI can look at it. Something Verizon sort of talked about was when they expect service revenue to decline or to just sort of moderate, is that something you see in the next few quarters here as you make up to 50% EIP?\\nKen Meyers\\nI understand the math in that. I think you\\'ve got -- as I said, there\\'s three component that are, as I think about, washing through average revenue per unit. One of those components is the EIP mix, one of them is the product mix, as between handsets and other connected devices. And then there is just the industry noise around pricing. Yes, as you stabilize the EIP mix, that piece of it will moderate, but you still have an ongoing mix within the industry as more connected devices get added in there or as customers continue to hold units longer and get -- bring in their own equipment and wind up with discount. So there is room around that one metric. But that metric again is an outcome and that\\'s something that individually gets driven and rather helps understand what\\'s going on within the business.\\nSimon Flannery\\nThank you.\\nVicki Villacrez\\nAnd from the M&A side, on the Telecom side of the house, we continue to evaluate potential cable acquisitions. We continue to stay focused on that. As you know, I can\\'t comment on any specific transaction until a definitive agreement is in place, but we\\'re looking at acquisitions that meet our criteria which again is around looking at our competitive and demographic criteria that we\\'ve shared before in the past.\\nAnd then again, from an HMS perspective, you know, we are making progress as I said in my earlier answer, and we have had a strong start to the year in terms of sales. And I really look for that to translate into higher revenue growth in the second half of the year. And as we continue to perform and meet our milestones, we may look at smaller acquisitions in addition to the generation of organic growth in that business. But that would a longer term initiative.\\nSimon Flannery\\nThat\\'s helpful. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sergey Dluzhevskiy with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nGood morning guys. A couple of questions if I could. So, first question, kind of a big picture question for Ken and Doug, so U.S. Cellular obviously has been turning around subscriber growth or so over the few quarters, but arguably investors have remained unimpressed including this morning. So in your opinion, what are investors missing in the investment story for U.S. and GDS? And what are the main building blocks in your opinion maybe you could reiterate for enhancing shareholder value in the near term and also in the long term?\\nKen Meyers\\nSergey, it\\'s Ken, let me just start with that. Up until few hours ago when the markets opened, I felt we were marching right down that path. I looked at what we produced for the quarter, what we produced relative to our guidance, what we produced relative to consensus and we\\'re really happy with where we started. The fact that we\\'ve got some part of our base that\\'s looking for something different, I can only deliver on what I\\'ve kind of set out as our strategy. And our strategy is to continue to improve our local market position, continue to strengthen the company, grow revenues and grow cash flows. And I don\\'t see anything else on the short-term horizon that\\'s going to either change our strategy or change our trajectory.\\nDoug Shuma\\nAnd, Sergey, I\\'ll just reiterate what Ken said, we\\'re pleased with the progress that U.S. Cellular has been making. It doesn\\'t come overnight. We\\'re committed to helping them be successful and at some point whether the shareholders recognize that or not, we think they will. We don\\'t have any imminent transactions engineering type things that would drive any immediate shareholder excitement if you will but we\\'re committed to U.S. Cellular.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nOkay. And a question -- another question for Ken. This is kind of relates to financial engineering or just looking at the asset base that you guys have. So, obviously you have a logical tower portfolio and you have been very clear that you’re not interested in monetizing the value of this portfolio, it\\'s core to your business. But could you share your thoughts as you look at your portfolio now and [indiscernible], what are your thoughts on making those as a value and contribution from this tower portfolio within the context of U.S. Cellular strategy so that it would be more adequately reflected in your share price?\\nKen Meyers\\nSergey, great question. As you so aptly put it, strategic asset. It\\'s important to us. It is critical as we continue to evolve our network and it\\'s critical especially given some of the -- I\\'ll call it games some of the tower companies are starting to play in terms of trying to extract more value out of their assets from their perspective of being a landlord. And so having a large portion of our towers that we own, and not subject to those pressures is important.\\nSecondly, we continue to lease out our asset. If I look at it kind of on a same-store basis or comparable basis, year-over-year basis, our tower rentals are up 10, about 11% year-over-year. And so we will continue to capture as much value as we can in the marketplace off of those assets, while retaining the strategic control we need so that we can continue to evolve our networks. And it\\'s amazing how we\\'re just finishing out 4G, we\\'re about to embark on voice over LTE which will require more modifications and people are already testing 5G, right? Well, you know, that\\'s going to put more strain on those very assets or increase their value even more in the future.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nRight. And last question for Doug, I mean given the relativity of the stock price and also kind of given your outlook maybe for the environment in cable space, how should we think about your appetite for buybacks this year and just in general?\\nDoug Shuma\\nYes, Sergey, I\\'m going to stick to the old answer to that. We\\'re committed to our investment strategy of, for every $3 we invest in the business, returning $1 to the shareholders over the long term and I think you\\'ll see that play out this year as well.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\\nJennifer Fritzsche\\nGreat. Thank you. Two if I may, I wanted to ask first on VoLTE, can you mention next year, it\\'s my understanding that for the CDMA player, it\\'s a harder path to VoLTE, which might explain why some of the GSM players are ahead of, like Verizon? And then wondering if you\\'re finding that as well that, maybe more technical question. And then secondly if I could ask about the competitive environment. We are -- C&T Mobile laid up a lot of this A block spectrum and get into more secondary market. Are you seeing any impact directly from them? Or is that -- it\\'s really not evidenced in the churn, but I wanted to ask the question, are you seeing still more either ET&T and Verizon as being the main competitors?\\nKen Meyers\\nGood morning, Jennifer. Thanks for the question. First of all, with respect to VoLTE, yes, there is a pretty well documented fact that the coverage on the voice side with CDMA is a wonderful, wonderful product. And when you\\'ve built your network with that product and you then try to overlay voice over LTE in the same cell site, there is an initiate coverage what I\\'d call gap almost. And it\\'s something that we saw in the tests that we ran last year, and it\\'s something that our deployment schedule has been built around in order to eliminate it. And there are various techniques our engineers are using such as moving equipment to the top of the towers which gets back to having control over those towers, so you can move your equipment when and where you need it. And they\\'re using other engineering tools so that when we do turn on VoLTE, we are able to deliver our customers the same and better services that they\\'re getting now. So that\\'s why we haven\\'t been rushing to it, wouldn\\'t be very deliberate and proceed with caution, like we have in every other technology change in the past.\\nAround your A block question, our primary competitors in our market are Verizon and AT&T in that order, and it\\'s based upon which of them has the original cellular license in that market, which allows us to have one of them and Verizon or AT&T and the other to really on an economical basis build out a very vibrant coverage area. That 700 have some of the very similar characteristics. And so we\\'ve heard about other carriers trying to build up their 700\\'s and increase their kind of competitive footprint. But particular to the question you asked about T-Mobile, they’re building out to my understanding the 700 A block, and we\\'ve been successful in most of our markets acquiring that 700 A block. So if we own it, they don\\'t own it.\\nJennifer Fritzsche\\nOkay.\\nKen Meyers\\nAnd we\\'re seeing them in a couple of markets but the most part they\\'re building out in markets around us, near us, and as we get to us turning on VoLTE, looking forward to be able to serve their customers as they roam into our markets.\\nJennifer Fritzsche\\nGreat. Thanks, Ken.\\nJane McCahon\\nWe\\'ve time for one more question operator.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi Group. Please proceed with your question.\\nMichael Rollins\\nHi, thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. Just a couple if I could, you know the first is just going back to the topic of ARPU, can you specifically disclose the performance of phone ARPU in its totality? And maybe just help us a little bit more on the bridge of contributing factors to ARPU performance during the quarter. I know you\\'ve given us a lot of commentary on the call to think about. I was just wondering you could put some more numbers to that. And then, you know, secondly, over time I think the management team has talked about the importance of being able to grow the top-line. And is there a timeframe over which investor could keep in mind in terms of when you\\'ll be able to answer that question as you get through the EIP migration and continue to contemplate the competitive landscape? Is that a 12-month observation period, 24-month observation period, any thoughts on that duration over which the answer should become more clear? Thanks.\\nKen Meyers\\nHey, Mike, that\\'s a couple of things. So, one, as I\\'ll look at -- I don\\'t have the information as I am sitting and talking to you now the bridge is one of the other talks about one component of the -- our revenue or not, we\\'ll look and see it, what might be in the corners of all of our other analysis. But I don\\'t have any of those here right now.\\nOn the timeframe, there isn\\'t a drop date. I think Doug talked about how we\\'re committed to this business. We continue to grow the customer base which is the precursor to growing the revenue. We also talked the work we\\'re doing around roaming. I\\'ve not talked about the work we\\'re doing around advertising. There are many different specs and logs kind of on the fire, the thing that we’re all working to drive revenue which is the key metric in any long term sustainable business. But I don\\'t have a drop dead date to give you.\\nMichael Rollins\\nThanks very much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. Ms. McCahon, there are no further questions. I\\'d like to turn the floor back to you for any final remarks.\\nJane McCahon\\nOkay. We\\'d like to thank everybody for joining us this morning and we\\'re available for questions throughout the day and we\\'ll probably see some of you next week. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. This concludes today\\'s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.',\n",

       "  \"Operator\\nGreetings, and welcome to the TDS and U.S. Cellular Second Quarter Operating Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Jane McCahon, Senior Vice President, Corporate Relations at TDS. Thank you, Ms. McCahon, please begin.\\nJane McCahon\\nThank you, Tim. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. I want to make you all aware of the presentation we have prepared to accompany our comments this morning, which you'll find on the Investor Relations sections of the TDS and U.S. Cellular websites.\\nWith me today and offering prepared comments are from U.S. Cellular, Ken Meyers, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and from TDS Telecom, Vicki Villacrez, Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.\\nThis call is being simultaneously webcast on the TDS and U.S. Cellular Investor Relations websites. Please see the websites for slides referred to on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. As a reminder, we provide guidance for both operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. For TDS Telecom, these are basically the same number. For U.S. Cellular, however, the adjusted EBITDA measure includes imputed interest income from EIP and significant contributions from our partnership, which we want to continue to highlight for investors.\\nThe information set forth in the presentation and discussed during this call contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Please review the Safe Harbor paragraph in our press releases and the extended version in our SEC filings.\\nAs mentioned on our previous calls, U.S. Cellular filed a short form application for the upcoming forward [ph] auction for 600 megahertz spectrum known as Auction 1002. As the anti-collusion rules are now in effect, we are prohibited from speaking about it further, therefore we will not entertaining any other questions relating to spectrum of the auction.\\nShortly after we released our earnings and before the call, TDS and U.S. Cellular filed their SEC forms 8-K, including today's press releases and their Form 10-Qs. Of note, in our 10-Qs we are now breaking out postpaid churn between handset and connected devices. TDS will be presenting at the Drexel Hamilton Conference in New York on September 7 and we're hosting analysts meetings at CTIA, in Las Vegas on September 8.\\nAnd please keep in mind that we do have an open door policy. So if you're ever in the Chicago area and would like to meet with members of management, the IR team will try to accommodate you, calendar's permitting.\\nNow, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Meyers.\\nKen Meyers\\nGood morning. I'll start with Slide 4. We're now halfway through the year and continuing to move forward. Our result reflects steady progress across multiple fronts. Smartphones and connected devices are growing, customer engagement continues to improve, the current network is performing well and our first voice over LTE build out is on track.\\nNow let's go little deeper starting with customer growth, our top priority. We are moving forward but still not at the pace I'd like to see. That's probably not surprising given the low churn rates we've seen across the industry and overall consumer weakness. We are having continued success with connected devices primarily tablets. Both gross and net additions are increasing and postpaid connections per account. A share of wallet metric was up 6%.\\nNet postpaid additions were more than twice than at last year at 36,000 once again driven by tablets and smartphones offset by the loss of feature phones. We continue to see good progress from our increased focus on small and medium-sized businesses in regional government entities. Handset growth adds for this segment continued to grow and our M10 [ph] sales are gaining momentum.\\nAs an organization, we're constantly measuring our customer satisfaction and adjusting our business practices and offerings to better meet their needs. Our survey showed this strategy is working is evidenced by our improving engagement scores in churn. I'm particularly encouraged by our continued improvement in postpaid churn 1.2% in the quarter, a record low for the company.\\nAs Jane mentioned in response to investor and analyst request, we've also begun to breakout postpaid handset and connected device churn, which at 1.10% and 1.84% also showed significant improvement from year ago. Our customers overall satisfaction is largely influenced by our network strategy. Last year, we completed our deployment of 4G LTE. It now reached 99% of our postpaid connections and today it's carrying almost 90% of all of our data traffic.\\nAdditionally, three 4G roaming agreements are in place, so our customers are now receiving better data experiences as they travel. Finally, so I said our network team is on track to launch our first commercial deployment of Voice over LTE early next year. I think it's important to note, the inflection point we've reached with our roaming agreements. This year, is one of significant transition as we move from 3G CDMA agreements to 4G LTE agreements to significantly lower the price per gigabit, both from revenue and expense point of view.\\nAlso our remarkably talented engineering group has lead the way in implementing technology that allows for data roaming and one network, with a fallback to another carrier for voice services. This will open up the door first provide data roaming to more than just CDMA based carriers and allows to better manage the quality of our customers roaming experiences.\\nSpend a few moments on revenue trends, overall total revenue growth is just about where we thought it would be. Service revenues are down due to multiple forces. Some of which are accounting our income statement geography, some of which are more real. First and largest, we have the impacted EIP adoptions which have the effect of moving service revenue to the equipment line.\\nAlso we have the still early but developing trend at the customer keeping equipment longer or bringing equipment with them and finally the ongoing soft pricing environment industry. These three factors combined to more than offset the positive impacts on service revenue of smartphone adoption which was now 77% of the postpaid handset base and our growth in prepaid and connected devices.\\nWithin EIP take rate of 69% in the quarter, our EIP penetration continues to grow rapidly and now is at 37% as compared to 20% a year ago. Of note, I'd also highlight that we have steadily improved the number of connections per account resulting in a year-over-year increase in average billings per account. Steve will provide more detail on these trends in a moment. But first let me lean into or perhaps share a new or different ways to think about upgrade rates.\\nHistorically, a lot of attention has been paid to upgrade rates because in a subsidized handset business model every time a customer wanted to move or upgrade to a new handset, the carrier would lose hundreds of dollars on the transaction and the customer signed a new contract. This upgrade rate was a metric that explained part of the equipment purchased [ph] each quarter, lower the upgrade rates improve the P&L. Conversely, increase the upgrade rate and negatively impact the P&L. We saw this a few years back as we transitioned off of rewards points, as a way to build customers stickiness and move back to contracts and headquarters of upgrade rates and the teams of the obvious P&L hit.\\nNot talked about or at least not talked about as much was a positive that came with us, which was more of a carrier's customer [ph] base was under contracts. In today's EIP driven business model, we've dramatically changed the economics of equipment transaction and now I look at this metric quite differently. With the P&L impact of upgrades dramatically reduced I look at renewal rates and the percent of base under contract as indicators of customer satisfaction and with 81% of our postpaid customer base under contract with us at the end of the quarter. I'm quite comfortable with where our renewal rate was this quarter, especially in light of all the anticipation it builds every time another iconic device launch approaches.\\nSpeaking of which, we will be ready to compete aggressively during the iPhone launch. We know there are still many non-U.S. Cellular customers out there that are still unaware that we carry Apple products. So we will be looking to increase that awareness and win their business. In summary, we've been making steady progress over the first half of the year and I expect to continue to move forward on our priorities during the second half.\\nAnd now, let me turn the call over to Steve.\\nSteve Campbell\\nThank you, Ken and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my comments with a few additional things to say about customer results shown on Slide 5 of the presentation. As Ken already mentioned, we grew connections during the second quarter with 36,000 postpaid net additions, a solid increase from 17,000 net additions a year ago. Growth was driven by positive results in both postpaid gross additions which increased 3% year-over-year to 197,000 and postpaid churn which improved again this quarter to 1.2% compared to 1.34% a year ago.\\nSimilar to the past few quarters the growth in postpaid net additions was driven by data centric devices like smartphones and connected devices, together they accounted for 57,000 net additions. In the prepaid category, we had 14,000 net additions, an increase from a year ago driven by the success of our new Simple Connect plans sold through our company and agent stores.\\nAs shown at the bottom of this slide, postpaid handset net additions were negative 13,000 an improvement from negative 19,000 in the prior year driven by reduced churn. However, although overall handset net additions were negative smartphone net additions were positive 8,000. Further when upgrades from feature phones are included total smartphone connections increased by 46,000 during the second quarter.\\nWe're providing more information about the smartphones on the next slide. Smartphones represented 91% of total handsets sold this quarter and smartphone penetration increased to 77% of our base of postpaid handset connections up from 69% a year ago. We believe that we still have some opportunity to upgrade more of our remaining feature phone customers to smartphones and drive additional data usage revenues.\\nThe next slide shows the longer term trend in our postpaid churn rate, which at 1.2% for the second quarter is at a historically low level. Now let's talk about our financial results starting with revenues. Total operating revenues for the second quarter were $980 million about the same as last year's $976 million. The small improvement in revenues reverses the trend of the last couple quarters when revenues declined both sequentially and year-over-year.\\nHowever as we look ahead, I need to remind you that last year's third quarter had a one-time bump up in revenue due to the elimination of the reward points program and we won't have another event like that, this quarter. Service revenues were $762 million down $62 million from $824 million last year. The largest component of service revenues retail service at $680 million decreased by 8% driven by lower average revenue per user. But this decrease in our pool was partially offset by the impact of growth in our customer base.\\nI'll come back and say more about ARPU in a minute. The other item contributing to the reduction in service revenues was lower, roaming which declined by $11 million or 23% primarily due to lower rates for data usage. Keep in mind that we benefit from lower rates on our outbound roaming traffic. Total expense for outbound roaming decreased by 11% year-over-year with lower rates offsetting a significant increase in data usage.\\nEquipment sales revenue grew 44% to $218 million driven by higher equipment installment plan sales. Percentage of postpaid device sales on installment plans increased to 69% in the second quarter, compared to 44% a year ago. We do expect the installment plan take rate to continue to increase over the course of the year.\\nNow I want to say a few words about our postpaid average revenue metrics. Postpaid ARPU was $47.37 for the second quarter, down 12% year-over-year. Most of this decline is driven by the continued migration to unsubsidized equipment pricing. Other factors include overall industry price competition and the growth in connected devices, which have lower average revenue.\\nSince the ARPU metric excludes equipment installment plan billings to customers another metric which includes those billings average billings per user may provide a better representation of the total amount of revenue being collected from customers every month. Reported this way, the average revenue shows a decrease of 3% year-over-year with about half of that decrease estimated to be, the dilution from connected devices.\\nThe average revenue per account benefits from the increase in connection per account which grew by 6%. For the second quarter, the average revenue per account was $124.91 down 7% year-over-year, but when equipment installment plan billings are included the average billings per account actually increased by 2% year-over-year. We expect that there will be continuing downward pressure on service revenues, but the equipment sales revenues will continue to grow as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized equipment pricing.\\nOperating cash flow for the quarter, shown next was in line with our expectations. Operating cash flow was $168 million compared to $162 million a year ago. Total cash expenses were essentially flat year-over-year with an increase in the cost of equipment driven by 6% higher volume offset by reductions in other cost categories. When looking at operating cash flow and the year-over-year comparison remember that this year's number includes the cost of the incremental customer growth that, we achieved. Retail gross additions increased by 5% and net additions increased from 25,000 to 50,000.\\nAdjusted EBITDA shown on the next slide incorporates the earnings from our equity method partnerships along with interest in dividend income which consist mainly of imputed interest income from our equipment installment plants. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $218 million compared to $207 million a year ago.\\nEarnings from unconsolidated entities were $37 million and this includes $20 million from the Los Angeles partnership, a slight increase from the year ago. Next I want to cover our annual guidance for 2016 which is shown on Slide 12 of the presentation. For comparison, we're showing our 2015 results both as reported and excluding the impact of the termination of the rewards programs.\\nOur current estimates for the year are unchanged from those provided initially in February and confirmed in May, I'll quickly review them. For total operating revenues, we expect range of approximately $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This reflects our continuing expectation for modest customer growth additional demand for data and increased adoption of equipment installment plans along with very competitive pricing environment.\\nThere is clearly uncertainty related of the impact of the new iPhone launch this fall, along with the normal uncertainty related to the holiday selling season. For operating cash flow we expect the range of $525 million to $650 million, that estimate also flows through to the estimated range for adjusted EBITDA which is $725 million to $850 million. To the extent that we achieve a lower level of customer growth and currently estimated, we would expect results to be in the upper portion of the ranges. On the other hand to the extent that we're successful in attracting higher level of customer growth than currently estimated or if the pricing environment worsens. We would expect results to be in the lower portion than the ranges.\\nCapital expenditures are expected to be about $500 million. This lower level of spending compared to 2015 reflects the completion of our 4G LTE deployment. It includes spending to meet higher data demand and to prepare for the initial commercial launch of Voice over LTE. I want to make just a couple of comments about U.S. Cellular's cash flows and liquidity. Cash flows from operating activities for the first six months of 2016 were $261 million while cash flows used for investing and financing activities totaled $355 million resulting in a net decrease in cash and equivalents with $94 million.\\nAs of June 30, cash and equivalents totaled $621 million, in addition to these existing balances U.S. Cellular has $283 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. We believe that these resources are sufficient to meet our operating investment and debt service requirements for the remainder of this year. Recall that the company has a 5.5% interest in the Los Angeles partnership and that the partnership had suspended cash distributions to the partners beginning in 2015 in connection with the purchase of spectrum license in FCC Auction 97.\\nWe were notified recently by the general partner, the note payable related to the license purchase will be completely repaid by June 30 and that cash distribution will be made in the third quarter of 2016. U.S. Cellular received a distribution of $9.6 million on July 28.\\nSo to wrap up the discussion of U.S. Cellular, I'll just reiterate what Ken said earlier. Overall, we've made steady progress over the first half of the year which results in line with our expectations and we're confident that we can continue to move forward on our priorities.\\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Vicki Villacrez to discuss TDS Telecom. Vicki?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nOkay, thank you Steve and good morning, everyone. TDS Telecom's overall results for the second quarter showed improvement over the first quarter as revenues strengthened in all three segments. First, Wireline revenues were nearly even with last year and it's adjusted for divestiture showed positive growth with a 5% increase in residential revenues. Second, Cable revenues grew 2% over the last year reflecting another quarter of strong broad brand subscriber growth of 12%. And third, HMS revenues grew 6% due to strong service revenue growth as well as increased equipment sales.\\nAs we continue to seek growth cash expenses increased in line with those revenues. As a result, adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis remains relatively flat at $80 million for the quarter. Our financial results are reflecting the successful execution of our strategy, as revenues for new products and services are offsetting declines in our legacy voice offerings.\\nWe are halfway through the year and we are tracking against our expectations. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on those strategic priorities that we shared with you on February which will be highlighted in the coming slides. Beginning with Wireline on Slide 15, our investments and our network and efforts to make higher speed options available to customer continued to drag growth in IPTV connections.\\nWe completed our planned IPTV market roll out last quarter, but continued to build out service in those 28 markets now enabling 180,000 service addresses. We are completing our planned fiber builds which will reach approximately 21% of our ILEC service addresses. And when combined with copper service, our IPTV enabled markets will cover approximately 25% of our total ILEC service addresses. For the reminder of the year, we will focus on further driving IPTV and high-speed broadband bundles in these markets.\\nTo further strengthen our broadband offerings, we are deploying bonding technology up to an additional 30% of our ILEC service addresses, in order to drive higher data speeds in our middle-tier ILEC copper markets. In our remaining markets, we are evaluating the FCC's modified universal service funding mechanism to support broadband build out.\\nRecall, that the FCC announced, a modified USF mechanism that is providing greater return carriers with two paths to receive support funds, to extend broadband services to un-served and underserved areas. TDS will need to make a decision on which support action it will elect, an alternative to connect to American Cost Models, which is commonly known as A-CAM or revised USS mechanism to say on greater returns.\\nIn order for us to make this termination, the FCC needed to finalize the amount of support that TDS would get if we elected the A-CAM path. We've just received the offer from the FCC which was made public this week. We are very pleased with the offer for $82.3 million of support revenue annual for 10 years. As it helps us provides a better, faster, broadband service to our most rural customers.\\nAdditionally will be provided funding for transition in the early years in certain states. This support comes with an obligation to build defined broadband speed to reach approximately 159,600 homes which will require a significant capital investment over a 10-year period. We have 90 days to make our decision to accept the FCC offer at which times the FCC may under certain circumstances revise their offer and we would have another 30 days to respond. The FCC's goal is to make this program effective January 1, 2017.\\nLooking at the metrics on the bottom of the slide. IPTV connections grew nearly 50% adding 13,300 compared to the prior year and we added 2,800 broadband connections excluding divestures. We are offering a variety of speeds up to 1 Gig service in all our IPTV markets. The uptick in IPTV has grown steadily and is now in an average penetration rate of almost 30% of residential service addresses. It is important to remember that 97% of our IPTV customers, subscribe to a triple play bundle which results in a low churn rate and continues to increase average revenues per connection, which is now up 4% to $43.67 in the quarter.\\nReflecting both our fiber and bonded copper deployments, residential broadband customers in these ILEC markets are continuing to choose higher speeds with 50% choosing speed of 10 megabits or greater and 19% choosing speeds of 25 megabits or greater. This will also contribute to the higher ARPUs we've been experiencing.\\nLooking at Slide 16, Wireline results were solid even with 2015 ILEC divestitures which reduced revenues and expenses about 1%. As reported residential revenues increased 4% as growth in IPTVs and broadband more than offset the decline in legacy voice service. The year-over-year decrease in ILEC residential voice connections improved to 2% excluding divestitures.\\nCommercial revenues decrease 4%, however we're seeing managed IP connections continue to increase. Wholesale revenues decreased only 3% partly due to favorable annual adjustments in the second quarter. Total Wireline service revenues held nearly even with the prior year at $175 million Wireline cash expenses increased 1% as increases in employee related expenses and IPTV programming cost outpaced the reduced cost of provisioning legacy services. As a result, Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 2%.\\nAs we stated in our strategy, we plan for capital intensity to decline this year, as we complete our fiber build out. In the quarter capital spending declined $4 million which resulted in a higher free cash flow compared to prior year. Slide 17 shows Cable connections grew 14,600 or 5% to 287,600. On the residential side connections increased driven by 12% increase in broadband and an 18% growth in voice.\\nThe residential broadband connection growth drove at 300 basis point increase in broadband penetration. And total commercial connections declined due to drop off in video, however broadband grew 11%. Staying with Cable operating performance for a minute on Slide 18. Residential revenues increased 3%, as increases from our connections growth was offset by continued promotional offerings.\\nCommercial revenues decreased 3% primarily due to a discrete adjustment that occurred last year, without this adjustment commercial revenues were up 5%. Total Cable revenues of $45 million reflected increase of 2% as reported. However without the impact of that adjustment revenues grew 5%. Cash expenses increased 7% due to the higher employee video programming cost and property taxes. As a result Cable adjusted EBITDA decreased.\\nTurning to the HMS segment and speaking to both Pages 19 and 20 in total. You can see HMS revenues grew 6% in the quarter, this was driven by service revenue growth of 11% from increased professional services and equipment maintenance revenue. This growth offset a 2% decline in recurring hosting revenues in the quarter. Equipment sales were up 3% year-over-year due to higher spending by existing customers.\\nCash expenses were up 2% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the commissions on the higher sales. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million to $7 million. Turning to Slide 21, we have provided our 2016 guidance which is unchanged from the guidance we shared with you in February, as we anticipate the second half of the year to be in line with our initial expectations and given the timing of the FCC USF reform order. We do not expect a significant impact to this year's results. But we will revisit this again in the third quarter as we learn more.\\nOverall we're pleased with our results of the second quarter and we'll continue to update you on our successful execution of our strategic priorities throughout the year. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jane.\\nJane McCahon\\nThanks, Vicki and Tim, we're ready for questions.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\\nRic Prentiss\\nCouple questions if I could, first, Ken you talked a lot about upgrade rates and how you look at it now because you definitely had a different trend in the industry, the industry was light on upgrades, you guys were little higher. But you also saw increasing gross adds which was something we hadn't really seen a lot. Can you wrap that around how you're looking at upgrades versus gross adds and then weave into churn also, I appreciate the postpaid phone churn number which is good. But is there further to drop on that given what you're trying to do with upgrades and gross adds kind of wrap that all into one question you can expound on.\\nKen Meyers\\nWell, Jay Ellison sitting here and every quarter we have this conversation about churn and you ask for lower and he squirms a little bit in his seat. But you're all connected, Ric and you got it right. It is, continuing to drive the satisfaction within our current base and as we continue to serve them well, make sure the network is where they needed, when they needed. We get to sell more services to that, so that drives our tablets, it drives other revenue line and with that comes lower churn both because a; first you're meeting our needs and then they're voting with their wallet to buy other services with you. As they do that, that also then unlocks word of mouth and it helps to fund the gross add side. We don't emphasize renewals versus growth ads, what one versus the other. We're looking to drive both of them.\\nRic Prentiss\\nAnd as far as churn, do you feel there is further improvement? On a couple of calls, for last couple of quarters you've been pretty optimistic on where you could drive churn to, obviously good number but is there more to go.\\nJay Ellison\\nRic, this is Jay. Since Ken is staring at me, I think I'll take that part of the question. I think we have done a superb job as the business is stabilised and we really put a lot of focus and earlier mentioned as we shifted to getting contract from place with around 81% of our base [ph] under some type of lock currently and on top of that, what we are doing now is obviously further refining those programs, we offer in the marketplace whether it's in the call centers or at the point of the sale to really target those customers and further reduce that churn.\\nI feel confident with the level of customer engagement that we are starting to see that we will continue to see improvement in that area and that is all that I think I will say at this point and Ken continues to stare at me.\\nKen Meyers\\nI've got it you doing it for me, Ric.\\nJay Ellison\\nThanks.\\nRic Prentiss\\nGreat and then actually whether to switch back to Vicki for a second on the FCC. The A-CAM order if you do elect that based on the FCC details you were given, the $82.3 million revenue per year for 10 years does that start in year one, as a consistent $82 million a year and is there some kind of thought we should lay out there as far as early thinking, as far as what the capital cost per home might be to deploy that type network.\\nVicki Villacrez\\nSure, thank you Ric. First off, let me just start by saying that. I'm very pleased with the FCC's offer to provide that support necessary to bring better and faster broadband services to a substantial portion of our customers, who live in rural locations. And quite frankly that is too costly for us to build a necessary network to without this level of support from the government. The offer of $82.3 million per year over the 10 years of support is a bit higher in the earlier years and that is to support. We've got a support transition mechanism that we'll aim to be higher in the early years and then it will taper off. So in total, I think the 10-year amount is the $852 million with that transition number and yes it's going to require us to deploy significant capital over that, over that timeframe. Right now we're deep into the network build designs to try to better understand those economics before accepting the model support versus staying on rate of return. And our acceptance will be on a state-by-state level and I think it's important to remember that all rate of return carriers going forward are going to have broadband build out obligations regardless of the USF option. So right now, we're making those estimates and we'll know more as we look at 2017. As I said I don't think this will impact 2016 too significantly, we'll revisit that back in the third quarter but we have a lot of work to do before we put anything else there in terms of the capital number.\\nRic Prentiss\\nOkay, that does based on your tone of being very pleased it does feel like you're going to be able to build something in order nice return and get people to service what they want.\\nVicki Villacrez\\nYes, we're pleased with the offer.\\nRic Prentiss\\nGreat, thank you.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Sergey Dluzhevskiy of Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question, Sergey.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nCouple questions, if I could. First one for Ken. You guys obviously have 4,000 towers that you own, have you look out into next two years as you're going to be deploying royalty and eventually possibly transfer for 5G. Can you talk about your strategy for utilizing those towers and how you could maximize the value and contribution from your core tower portfolio?\\nKen Meyers\\nThanks, Sergey. Yes those towers are critically important to us, it allows us control over our network deployment plans and given our whole strategic positioning around quality it ensures that we have access, where we needed but it turns out it's almost two-thirds of our towers now. Also it protects us from some of the rent increases we've been hearing about in the industry and other kind of economic battle, so I'm very happy that we've got those towers. We will continue to work on growing revenues off those towers by leasing those to other parties, but they are in a fundamental underpinning to our whole networking position and I'm real glad that we've got.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nGreat. And I have two questions for Vicki. On A-CAM so obviously you're pleased with award $82 million I think last year in total. You guys were all federal USF you received about $74 million, $75 million could you remind us what is the comparable number for this $82 million. What portion of $74 million, compares to the $82 million.\\nVicki Villacrez\\nYes, so the comparable number I think you're citing a total federal support number. The comparable number is more on the average about $50 million annually and that's coming from two, it's really replacing two funding mechanisms and our carrier loop support, their high cost loop support.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nRight, great and the second question on Cable acquisitions and kind of what your view is of current deal environment in the Cable space and your potential deal pipeline and if, I mean have you see some properties that maybe you came close to, I mean close to came close to passing your M&A criteria but the end of the day you decided not to pull the trigger and what were the main reasons you decided for say not to purchase them.\\nVicki Villacrez\\nWell okay so, let me just say right now from an opportunity standpoint. We are seeing more activities and we saw the last half of last year. I mean it was very quiet in the last half of last year. So we're seeing more activity not particularly robust but I would say we're seeing a few more opportunities and as you know, I can't comment on and even specific in the pipeline right now. But again I wanted to reiterate we are actively pursuing Cable acquisitions and are very bullish on our Cable strategies.\\nSergey Dluzhevskiy\\nThanks.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\\nPhil Cusick\\nA few if I can. First, Ken. Inbound roaming was up nicely year-over-year for the first time in a long time. What's the dynamic happening with potential partners?\\nKen Meyers\\nSo I think the number is, you're obviously wrong there. Actually the roaming revenue is down year-over-year. I think Slide 8 would show that, traffic continues to grow its pricing. As pricing that also close right through to our cost line. We're going to where we need to go and want to go. It's not that we're going someplace we don't want to go. Dynamic around roaming is really getting playing us just the way that, I hope it would like to see it. We've got, now three agreements that we've executed. We're going to should we turn it out and couple more as I mentioned, our engineers have been leaving the pack and getting some technology implement that actually allows us to deliver to our customers when they're roaming data on one network, voice on a different one and what that does is that it lets us, continually monitor the customer experience to make sure that we get the best experience for our customers, wherever they're at. On the other side what that also means is that, in the past all of our roaming only been from CDMA based carriers and we thought eventually when we got to VoLTE we'd be able to serve more carriers, this would allow us to at least meet the data needs to other carriers before we get all the way to VoLTE.\\nSo it's got some real positives behind it. Anything that's going on with roaming, is as our customers now get a better 4G experience as they travel. We're seeing an increase in usage from them just like we saw increase of usage when they got 4G in our own network. So couple dynamics on there, but I'm happy with where roaming is setting up in terms of the revenue picture going forward.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay, so if we could ignore me being totally incorrect to start, should we start looking at the stabilizing going forward? Is that fair?\\nKen Meyers\\nI don't know, yes it should whether it's this quarter that we get there, whether it might from a past standpoint sequentially I got one more in front of us, but yes we should be.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay, that's great. And then Ken higher churn of tablets versus phone that's great to break out. Does that - looking at that make you question a little bit more the value would you be easy, you still feel good about that?\\nKen Meyers\\nNo we're still, it's resting. We look at this, we look at it regularly there still nice adjunct products along a couple of different dimensions. So yes they're generating incremental revenue and incremental margins and as I said, we looked it as recently as probably last month. But in addition to that, it really goes a long way to strengthening that customer relationship and so even though you may see a higher churn rate and tablet, albeit a low rate by historic standards. It's higher than smartphones is an example. But it strengthens the overall relationship of the account. And so I'm not going to really worry about that and even at 1.8% besides the economics happen [ph] it continues to improve. It's - pretty nicely year-over-year.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay, you also Ken bought back some stock at U.S. Cellular in the second quarter with the LA distribution coming back on, should we look for buybacks to ramp in the third quarter?\\nKen Meyers\\nThe LA distribution wasn't you know a reason to buy or not buy the U.S. Cellular. At the U.S. Cellular level our buyback is primarily to design just to offset the dilution that comes every year out of our different benefit plans. So that change in LA status, which we kind of anticipating isn't a big driver one way or another with our level.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay and last one, if I can for Vicki. HMS equipment sales I saw nice pick up this quarter. Is that seasonal or should we be thinking that business is starting to catch some traction?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nSo yes, we had nice service revenue growth in the second quarter 11%, but that growth was really driven and generated by primarily professional services and selling equipment maintenance agreements on hardware purchases, so that's more one-time type revenues. These are important to our customer and our business, but we really want to see more revenue growth coming from our cloud and hosting areas, which is the recurring service revenue that really leverages our data centers and our managed service offerings. So that with strong professional services and maintenance agreements.\\nPhil Cusick\\nAnd what should we be thinking in terms of ramp in that cloud and hosting?\\nVicki Villacrez\\nSo the ramp and the cloud and hosting, I think year-to-date has been, I think you could translate it and to the low-to-mid single digit growth for the year.\\nPhil Cusick\\nOkay, thanks Vicki.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] If there are no further questions, I'll like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\\nJane McCahon\\nWe'd like to thank you all for your participation on summer Friday. So if you have any other follow-up questions let us know or we'll look forward to seeing you over the next few months. Thanks so much.\",\n",

       "  \" Operator\\nGood morning. My name is Lori, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weatherford International Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, today's call is being recorded. Thank you.\\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Karen David-Green, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Ms. David-Green, you may begin your conference.\\nKaren David-Green\\nThank you, Lori and good morning everyone. With me on today's call from Houston we have Bernard Duroc-Danner, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Krishna Shivram, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\\nBefore we start our comments, I'd like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our third quarter press release for the customary caution on forward-looking statements and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\\nAnd now I'd like to hand over the call to Krishna.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nThank you Karen and good morning everyone. Today I am going to focus most of my comments on the cash flow and the balance sheet including debt and debt covenants. I will start with a brief recap of our operating performance in the third quarter. Sequential incrementals were 2% and the year-over-year decrementals were 29% which are not only excellent but also leagues ahead of the decrementals registered in 2009.\\nOn a full nine months basis, the year-to-date decrementals were a best in class 28% and easily beat our larger peers whose decrementals range between 31% and 40%. These low decrementals are a testament to the effectiveness of the cost management efforts made by the company this year in response to the down cycle.\\nLoss per share for the quarter before charges and credits was $0.05. The revenue of $2.24 billion for the quarter decreased 6% sequentially and 42% year-on-year. Operating income margins before R&D and corporate expenses improved by 47 basis points sequentially to 5.4%. On an overall basis sequential improvements in our North American operations and our international land drilling rigs business more than offset a decline in our international performance.\\nBelow operating margins both are R&D and corporate cost show sequential declines reflecting cost reductions steps that were taken. Going forward both R&D and corporate cost will continue to trend down from third quarter levels. Foreign exchange losses consumed $0.02 of EPS, and asset write offs in sub Sahara, Africa of $0.01 completely offset a gain of $0.03 on repurchasing long dated bonds that were quoting well below par during the third quarter. In addition this repurchase will reduce annual interest cost by $15 million in 2016 and beyond.\\nThe tax benefit recorded in third quarter reflected the tax benefit on the losses in the U.S. primarily which are recoverable partly offset by tax provisions internationally where we continue to be profitable. The weighted average tax rate for the year will be in the low to mid 30s and will be a net tax benefit. In summary, our continuing cost management efforts and improved North American operating results coupled with the relative resilience offered international margins and a boost from our rigs businesses allowed us to improve sequential operating income on 153 million lower revenue.\\nMoving onto net debt and cash flow now. Net debt reduced by $28 million to reach 7.19 billion at the end of the third quarter reflecting positive free cash flow from operations of $123 million. The third quarter is normally a challenging quarter for free cash flow as it has a higher cash interest payment to bond holders by about 100 million compared to the second quarter. This year it has been even more challenging than other years because in addition to the extra cash interest burden we have $33 million of net cash consumption on the Zubair contract and $46 million of cash severance payments.\\nDespite these headwinds our focus on actively managing our working capital, CAPEX, and our cost base has resulted in the reduction of working capital by $170 million and CAPEX dropped by $56 million from the second quarter to reach $131 million for the third quarter. This was the first time we have generated positive free cash flow in the third quarter of a year since the third quarter of 2010 in spite of much more challenging business conditions. During the quarter we paid $120 million as a onetime settlement of the Freedman case which is the last class action law suit related to our financial restatements.\\nIn addition we opportunistically repurchased $236 million of book value of our long-term debt generating a onetime pretax gain of $35 million while also reducing our future annual interest cost by 15 million. This action demonstrates our confidence in generating enough free cash flow from operations consistently allowing us to not only manage business needs but also manage maturing debt in 2016 and 2017, which we expect to repay with free cash flow.\\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, working capital will continue to generate positive free cash flow through till the end of the year while we expect positive cash flows from the Zubair contract based on milestone dates we are currently targeting, our capital expenditure plan for the year has now been revised down by another $100 million to $650 million which is 55% lower than 2014 levels. Our fourth quarter free cash flow target is between $200 million and $300 million which will make us free cash flow positive for the entire year for the first time since 2010. Coupled with first quarter 2016, free cash flow which we also expect will be positive. This will fully finance the maturing bond of 350 million in February of next year.\\nAs of September 30th, available liquidity was $1.7 billion, meaning we have a large borrowing cushion still available to us. I would like to clarify a few matters around our covenants. Firstly we have no financial or leverage covenants. I repeat, we have no financial or leverage covenants at all on our public bonds. There are also no rating, no credit agency rating triggers either.\\nThe only covenant we have is on our revolving credit facility and this is set at a 60% debt to total cap ratio. The definition of the covenant is as follows, in the numerator the number used for debt includes total debt, including adjustments for derivative positions. As of September 30th this number is $7.72 billion which is 14 million higher than a 10-Q reported balance sheet debt number. In the denominator we add the same total debt number to the equity number to get the total capitalization number. The equity number is defined in the covenant definition as including minority or non-controlling interest and allows an add back for foreign currency translation adjustments on non-monetary assets held around the world.\\nDue to the extraordinary strength of the U.S. dollar this year versus most global currencies, the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment as of September 30th is $1.4 billion. Adding this adjustment to the 10-Q reported net equity of $5.75 billion, the adjusted equity for covenant purposes is 7.16 billion resulting in a total capitalization number of 14.88 billion. The debt to cap ratio thus calculated as of September 30th is $7.72 billion of debt divided by $14.88 billion of total capitalization which is 51.9%. This compares to 51.8% as of June 30th, meaning the ratio has hardly moved in Q3. This also means there is plenty of headroom on the covenant and we believe there is absolutely no danger of breaching it particularly in the projected scenario of continuous free cash flow generation and pay down of debt.\\nI would now like to offer a view on next year's cash flow. Our ability to generate positive free cash flow next year is dependent on three key variables. The first is the net cash flow from the Zubair EPF contract in Iraq. Based on the milestones dates we currently forecast which would trigger contractual payments further augmented by potential settlements of extra contractual claims we have made on our customer for change orders. We expect 2016 to be a net cash flow positive year for this contract with a year-over-year $200 million cash inflows versus 2015.\\nThe second key variable is cash severance and restructuring cost. In 2015 we will end up spending about $170 million in cash severance cost by year-end. In 2016, our current view is that this would not exceed more than $20 million meaning that year-on-year we would have an improvement of at least $150 million on this account. The third key variable is capital expenditure. Based on the quantity of excess equipment we have in all product lines, we do not envisage any growth CAPEX for 2016 even if activity levels increase. We will incur maintenance CAPEX of course. This will be in the order of $400 million which is $250 million lower than in 2015.\\nWhen you add the impact of these three variables together, the incremental cash flow in 2016 versus 2015 is $600 million. We are confident that variations in earnings and working capital should nullify each other. Given a range of 150 million to 250 million of free cash flow this year, adding the 600 million on these three key variables will provide more than enough cash to repay both the February 2016 maturity of 350 million and the June 2017 debt maturity of $600 million.\\nWe have also adopted much better controls on our external spend in terms of expenditure and CAPEX purchase orders. There is sharing of equipment, inventory, and other materials right across the company. Product lines and businesses have asset utilization goals and cash flow related targets. And all of these measures have helped in reducing cost, increasing discipline, and improving cash flow.\\nWe now have a leaner and more focused organization setting us up for strong incrementals in earnings and cash flow when activity levels increased overtime. This can be achieved quite simply by constraining three variables as we grow. Firstly, we will constrain CAPEX until we mop up all the excess equipment we have and fully utilize the extensive infrastructure we have built globally over the years. We believe we can subsist on a maintenance CAPEX diet for the next three years notwithstanding activity growth.\\nSecondly we will constrain support costs until the support ratio gets to the 30% to 35% range. We believe this can be achieved both by reducing further our support structure as well as adding more direct headcount when activity returns. And lastly controlling external spending particularly discretionary spending is very well managed now.\\nIn summary, we believe that we have managed the down cycle well with best in class year-to-date decrementals of 28% that are better than all of our larger peers and materially lower than the 140% decrementals experienced during the last down cycle. This would not have happened in the past. Weatherford is truly a different company today. With that I will now turn the call over to Bernard.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nThank you Krishna and good morning everyone. Q3 earnings per share is loss of $0.05. Taxes reflect the fact that operating losses were in the U.S. which are efficiency tax affected. We took $0.02 of foreign exchange losses and $0.03 on bond repurchases and we took about $0.01 write off in SSA. As a synthesis operations delivered results consistent with the $0.05 loss. It is difficult to describe a quarter in which we remain unprofitable but successful. But it was, we are making operational progress and this isn't a random event. We see similar sort of operational performance in Q4 and thereon.\\nI’ll focus my comments today on three issues; the operating underpinnings of the Q3 results, forward use for Q4, and our direction. First, operational underpinnings of Q3, North American NAM reported significantly stronger numbers in Q2. There were three factors behind the performance; cost, share gains, and Canada. Cost cuts, we were early and we were in deep and we did not pause in our efforts. We are just transforming the U.S. cost structure. It goes beyond aggressively cutting direct cost with declining volume.\\nWe also address equally aggressively the support structure. We de-lever the organization, rationalize facilities infrastructure, upgraded the talent bench both internally and through outside hires. It is still work in process but through year-to-date a considerable change in operating economics has been achieved. The quarter’s results in the midst of a miserable market was a clear demonstration of what could be achieved with a relentless operating focus.\\nNAM is ahead of our head of our international operations efficiency. The international segments will catch on very quickly with NAM. Measurable share gains in our core product lines, we had the most gain, bring services, completion, and artificial lift. The particular base seems to be credited depending on the product line it was widespread from California to the Marseilles including Europe and Utica and the Permian.\\nAt the same time we purposely scaled back operations and therefore share for two product lines, grading tools otherwise known as rentals and pressure pumping. In both cases there are essentially no barriers to entry, vast supply of equipment, and increasing punitive economics. We won't pursue contracts that have punitive returns. We don’t have to and we won't. We would rather let others do so.\\nThird factor, seasonal improvement in Canada. Canada helped but it wasn’t the factor it normally is. The seasonal recovery was somewhere between anemic and non-existent. What moved Q3 isn't Canada or it’s not Canada alone by far. We are doing fundamental efficiency work in the U.S. addressing the structural as well as the cyclical and the talent bench. The U.S. will be transformed operational and we’re finished. But expect this trend to continue in Q4.\\nInternational was down sequentially both revenues and margins. The cause and effect was different depending on the particular regions. We experienced volume declines in Asia, SSA, and Latin America. SSA was made worse by an asset write off. Latin Americas decline occurred in Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, and Columbia in that order of descending magnitude.\\nWe also had product and service delivery delays by client election in Europe and MENA pushing revenues into Q4. Averaging Q3 and Q4 will provide a better picture where our profitability will settle in those two large regions. MENA and Europe will be stronger in Q4 and of course we had continued strong performance in Russia and Argentina. And we are in the midst of the same operating season internationally as we are expected in NAM, we are one quarter behind in execution, we should expect the same results.\\nQ4 outlook, the overall market will be weaker in Q4 than in Q3 in both NAM and international markets. Assessment of the near-term is not that dissimilar to what has been shared by our peers. We also agree somewhere between Q4 and Q1 will be the low where they are cyclical to pressure. In this environment our Q4 is likely to be as follows. We expect NAM results to show lower revenues by low double-digit. But we are planning for an operating income only marginally down versus Q3.\\nInternational will be overall flat both at the revenue and operating income line. This is inspite of the anticipated market decline. Here again there will be regional differences. Latin America results are likely to show low revenues and commensurate declines in operating profits. We should manage decrementals in United America very patiently. This region has done so consistently.\\nEastern Hemisphere results are likely to show modestly higher revenues and an increase in profitability. Adding all the pieces together that is NAM and international, Q4 is expected to show single-digit lower revenues and near flat operating income. This is for core. The rigs which are run standalone and had a respectable Q3 are likely to decline sequentially. A few of our rigs are demobilized and in transit in Q4, will start up in late Q1.\\nThe company will be free cash flow positive in Q4. In fact Q4 should be our highest free cash flow quarter for 2015. We will be free cash flow positive for the full year. In prior calls we indicated and estimated $150 million to $250 million range for the year for the free cash flow for the full year of 2015. We will likely close the year on the upper end of that range. Net debt will decline to under 7 billion.\\nTo give more detailed regional review for the international segment, MENA will play an increasingly important role as it unfolds its turnaround. The progression will come from incremental business in the two largest Gulf markets, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia which is also broadening with contractual wins in Algeria, Oman, Qatar, and Egypt. We are gradually recovering market share lost years ago. MENA will be progressively stronger in quarters ahead and we are quite sure of this.\\nRussia was severely hit by the Rouble exchange rate but from an incremental business volume standpoint our Russian regions will continue to do well driven by share gains and formation valuation and well construction. Russia's volumes are showing essentially flat quarter in Q4 inspite of the onset of the winter season. Clients are moving activity in opposite directions but the nut and bolt is the flat activity level.\\nEurope Caspian activity will be stronger at the revenue line from Q3 levels with some improvements and profitability coming out of the UK and the Caspian. These are primarily service and product line sales originally expected in Q3. SSA, activity will continue to experience slow down and project delays. Our operations though have had some counter cyclical gains and expect progress in well construction and overall market penetration. As a result we expect revenues and profitability in Q4 not to deteriorate any further on Q3.\\nAsia has experienced much lower activity driven by large budgetary cuts in Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, and China, across the Board really. We expect activity wise it has just about bottomed out albeit at a very low level of activity. A combination of share gains and well construction and completion together with aggressive cost actions underway is mitigating the volume and pricing declines. Asia results will be about flat in Q3.\\nLatin America, we will manage a further decline in Mexico, Columbia, and Brazil. Share gains in well construction completion and rig services and the lower cost structure will manage decrementals efficiently and keep the regions profitability at a high level. Both Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America and aggressively implementing similar cost efficiency actions as the NAM together with a tight focus on sales and marketing of our core product lines. Combination of this and our improved operations in NAM makes a less spark outlook for Q4, versus our larger peers. As mentioned earlier, rigs will have low revenues operating income in Q4 both picking it back up when rigs are mobilized and new contract wins in early 2016.\\nComments on direction, our direction is clear to all within Weatherford. We are changing the rules of engagement in all of our business dealings. We focus on core cost and cash. We build on our operating progress to date with more efficiency, cash discipline, systematic talent upgrades, and market share focus. We changed operating economics perennially or we try to. We de-lever the balance sheet through free cash flow generation quarter-after-quarter with no exceptions. This is no direction.\\nNow we have to clarify one point, as a matter of strategic choice we’ll not participate in any bidding for divested assets. We have abundant opportunities internally to generate high returns through efficiencies, high grading talents, and harvesting considerable stock of technology and worldwide setup infrastructure. The absence of any distraction is a taxable advantage for 2016 and 2017.\\nWe made an exception for Sperry. This is a one off situation for our core. The interest in Sperry based on the high level of operating efficiencies given the service and infrastructure intensity of the business. Sperry is a hard business to run standalone for any non-strategic owner. The economics was strong but it could not overcome the cost of capital. Cost of capital matters and we are disciplined. This is now a closed issue. There will be no other bidding attempts on any other divested assets. As I said earlier on we have high returns and lower risk opportunities internally.\\nThis is the kind of market in which we can make fast and deep cost progress as structural changes to redirect a culture and rebuild a strong bench. Our action centers around improving these things and doing so in a perennial way. Lower cost structures through cycles, capital allocation, and cash generation as a companywide discipline, Leap Frog talent bench and talent development as a culture.\\nI’ll try to provide some color on some of the accomplishments, our work in progress. I will focus on this year's cost action understanding we started and acted earlier last year. In July we announced the increase of the reduction in force exercise 11,000 employees. In early September we increased the target to 14,000 employees or little over 25% of the workforce at the start of the year. As of October 15th, we have released 12,153 employees generating annualized cost savings of 926 million.\\nThe savings have resulted in the excellent decrementals experienced to date companywide. These savings will roll over in 2016, with more impact than this year. Our support ratio did for 41.5% -- to 41.5% for 45% sum of the year continues to target a sub 40% support ratio by year end and low to mid 30% by 2017.\\nWe ended last year with 56,000 employees and we ended the third quarter with a headcount of 42,800 employees. Of this rigs represent about 5000 employees and our core business 37,800. We are likely to close the year with a headcount closer to 41,000 and our core at 36,000.\\nWe had also planned to shutdown seven of our manufacturing facilities this year, five have been closed down to date with one planned each for the next two quarters. Separately we have shutdown and consolidated 70 operating facilities across North America to date. We expect to close 20 more by year end.\\nWe’re not cutting into muscle, we are adding muscle by high grading internally. And we are selectively adding new hires to specific positions to strengthen our bench. We run the company with eight regions and 12 product lines inclusive of rigs. So journey to date we have changed six out of our eight Regional Vice Presidents in which four internal high grading and two were outside hires. We have changed seven out of our 12 product line needles again in combination of three internal high grading and four outside hires.\\nThis entire open organization is going through the same strengthening process. Again this has everything to do with efficiency and productivity. It will pay off. At a company like Weatherford, we never push this as far as we could go. I just have a few comments on the synthesis. The oil industry at this point unsustainably are underfunded and under invested. Pessimism is everywhere. It is neither reasonable nor realistic. If cut all pricing and related all selectivity in Europe that will deteriorate further. We do not believe the industry will be able to manage required oil supplies as early as 2017. This means oil demand will not be met by existing oil capacity. And the Toyota angle [ph] will help, that isn’t sustainable solution for long we are quite sure of this.\\nWe used the qualifier to decline rates on destiny as a summary of why this is an intractable fact. Declining rates are in our view the most important structural factor to consider, more so where the demand growth in 2016 will be $1 million, $1.2 million, $1.5 million per day.\\nThe present state of industry depression has offered us great opportunities. We are positioning Weatherford with selected markets and clients using our product line strengths. We are using the brutal recession to fundamentally change our cost structure, quality, efficiency, and talent strength. This is today a very different company. Our operating and management capabilities are immeasurably stronger than they historically were.\\nWe have a worldwide infrastructure and service support second to none. We are confident of our technological strengths, of our product line and breadth, and the market potential for organic growth. Our numbers ultimately will prove out the merits of our direction in this brutal down cycle and where the market ends. We believe this is what will deliver by far the highest soluble returns at the lowest risk. This direction will not change. With that I would turn the call to operator to Q&A.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Jim Crandell of Cowen Securities. Your line is open.\\nJames Crandell\\nGood morning everyone and congratulations on the strong free cash flow and the North American performance.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nThank you Jim.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nThank you.\\nJames Crandell\\nFirst question is, it is kind of a comment Bernard and maybe you can -- you will answer it, I am just going to make a comment and then a question, both about North America. I guess my comment is that the businesses that really gained share have either been through a change of ownership recently as in the case of large initial left [ph] or companies going through a merger in the case of Halliburton and was curious as to your thoughts on how that's maybe contributing to your share gains? And then my question on North America is, if you could at least give some kind of guidance, how much of the North American losses are in frac?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nOkay, let me -- I think on the first question, there isn’t an evidence of any particular share gains on any of our larger peers. We have anecdotal evidence here and there but I wouldn’t say there is a passion at all, not today. I mean most of the share gains from our product lines have to do with particular technology offerings and/or product introduction and/or ability to be very efficient. So it is not -- there isn’t a particular story there. One play or another using market share in any particular product lines, not today. This is self observation. With respect to where the losses are, I think it is fair to say that if we didn’t have especially in United States I think North America will be breakeven or profitable without a doubt. I think if you also didn’t have rental tools you would actually be actually profitable. So there you have your answer.\\nJames Crandell\\nWow, okay. You know you gave a good rundown on the fourth quarter, if we continue in that sort of flattish oil price environment Bernard, how would you see the trends in quarter one and quarter two and operating results both in North America and international?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nIt is complicated because you have seasonality of course. If you adjust the seasonality, please believe that the market low will be as I have tried to convey between Q4 and Q1. This is activity low. Now you got to adjust the seasonality. For example Russia and Asia goes down in the Q1 as you know as does follow the North Sea whereas Canada goes up however anemically in Q1. So you have seasonality.\\nBut our view is that from an operating income from an earnings perspective I think the company’s performance will be similar to what it has been in Q3 with two sort of adjustments to think about; one is rigs. Those numbers may go down and then back up again, that is one factor. It is not immaterial but it is not the core either but it is a number. The other numbers to watch of course is if what happens on the foreign exchange losses and if we do or don’t have gains on further volume purchases these sorts of things that will impact the earnings.\\nBut I think from an operating income standpoint although we expect operating income to be marginally lower in NAM we don’t expect it to be any lower internationally in Q4. In fact a little bit up in Q1. I would say that probably international will be down versus our Q4 simply because of the seasonality. NAM hard to tell Q1, I don’t expect anything dramatic in Q1 because in Q1, Canada will help a bit more in Q1, U.S. a bit less because seasonality will see other way in the U.S.\\nNothing dramatic out of NAM in Q4 and Q1. International better in Q4. International possibly good seasonality a bit weaker in Q1, and from Q2 we think international actually starts to heal based on cost efficiencies and particular gates. There are some reasons that will shine. Expect MENA to shine actually in Q1. It will be sort of the standout region, etc because there are different factors at play there. Sorry for the long answer.\\nJames Crandell\\nNo, that’s fine. And a final question if I could for Krishna, what would if there is a downgrade of your debt by the rating agencies what would that mean for Weatherford?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nJim, that would really have no discernible impact on Weatherford. First of all there will be no loss of access to the rep markets in anyway because the CP market and the revolver are interchangeable and the revolver backs up the CP in any case. So there would be no loss of access.\\nAs I said before in our prepared comments we have a $1.7 billion of liquidity available at the end of September and we expect that amount of liquidity to keep growing overtime as we generate more free cash flow, so no loss of access. In terms of cost, our cost of borrowing may go up slightly and our analysis tell us that it is probably going to increase our interest cost next year by $11 million for the full year versus this year. But then again you’ll see from our buybacks or bonds in Q3, as also we did the same thing in Q1, we bought back some bonds in Q1 of this year. The savings and interest that we generated out of those buybacks are in excess of 25 million so far. So really the overall cost impact is not going to be material. If anything there is a cost benefit because of the buybacks going forward. So really no impact there.\\nAs far as company business is concerned we don’t have a single instance that we know of at all where our customers demand a certain credit rating to qualify for contracts. This is not a question that's asked on any tender or any contract anywhere in the world. So really there is no major impact of any sort that we can see if a downgrade does occur. We are talking to the rating agencies regularly and we’ll see where that goes.\\nJames Crandell\\nOkay, thank you.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\nOle Slorer\\nThank you again and congrats on the performance, it was nice to see.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nThank you Ole.\\nOle Slorer\\nSo just going forward a little bit it sounds as if what you are guiding is a rebalancing of the very strong Latin American margins down a little bit and more of an even performance between those in Eastern Hemisphere, is that the way to read it?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nI think that is to say fairly. On the Eastern Hemisphere I would suggest as we average both Q3 and Q4 to get the right picture not that Q3 was very, very bad but I think Q4 maybe a little bit better than we have. Rig business move from one to the other, should we average them both to get a picture but I do think what you said is correct.\\nOle Slorer\\nAnd when it comes to the reduction in CAPEX next year just to get some more clarity, was that because of a reduction in investments in rentals and pressure pumping predominantly. What are the biggest deltas in terms of taking it down that much?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nNo, it isn’t, we are not seeing any money pressure pumping and bear minimum in drilling tools. So that is not so much that will likely continue. No, I think Krishna will comment on it, I would just say that we have taken stock methodically of the abundance of tools and equipment we have company wide, worldwide. We also improved dramatically, the visibility because you can't move and use things unless they are very visible, measurable, and therefore movable. And we also changed the culture, so the culture of holding on to equipment, hoping for better day versus the efficient allocation resources, equipment and tools move, well that got done. We now have a pretty good picture of what we have and what we could use and for how long. And our decisions on CAPEX come from that particular analysis, Krishna might want to comment also.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nYeah, secondly I would say that we had quite an overhang of CAPEX orders coming from 2014 into 2015. If you look at our CAPEX in the first half of 2015 they really represented orders that were issued out of Weatherford at a time when the prognosis was much more rosy of the business. If you look at the orders that are outstanding today, CAPEX orders, and you just carry that forward into next year it is quite easy to see that we can reduce the CAPEX to 400 million. In fact that run rate is being achieved in Q4 this year already pretty much.\\nAnd secondly yes, exactly as Bernard said we have enough CAPEX to manage at least 25% to 30% growth in physical activity from where we are now with no promise whatsoever without adding to any growth CAPEX as a company. We just need maintenance CAPEX. So, this is what I meant by saying we can subsist on a maintenance CAPEX diet for a quite a long time going into the future. It represents an overspending of several years in the past.\\nOle Slorer\\nAnd just to understand the need for maintenance CAPEX, how much of that is tied to capacity loss in hole drilling equipment or other sort of businesses that are being reimbursed by your customers versus things you need to do on your own?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nWell, I mean, we are including the lost-in-hole. Now I can't give you a number how much of the 400 million we are guiding to next year as lost-in-hole at this point. But this year's CAPEX includes normal replacement and next year's CAPEX will do the same.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nAnd the easy answer maybe simply is that $400 million of net lost-in-hole [indiscernible]. It is easier to understand.\\nOle Slorer\\nAnd finally on the Middle East improvements, how much of that is because of loss making contracts that are coming to an end and how much versus…?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nThat is a good question. On two separate tracks, when we finish cleaning up all the administrative problems we have had, the next step was taking stock of the fact that company was very inefficient because the distractions also had entered a number of bad contracts also because of distraction. Now, what we see on the bad contracts, I think with Zubair with no offense to the people working on Zubair are hard to finish it was a terrible contract. That is a loss [ph] contract they need and didn’t qualify it in the Middle East. And that contract is coming to an end operationally.\\nThe progress you are seeing is essentially the slow but methodical quarter-by-quarter climb from reentering markets, reintroducing product lines, using our infrastructure to remain intact throughout our decline into various markets that have been leased. It is not only Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, all the other countries I mentioned Hawaii [ph] to Oman, Qatar, Egypt, Algeria which we almost exited not that long ago is rebuilding step by step. It is steps ready to factor that is driving it. With the end of Zubair, there are no other sort of bad contracts so these terrible years, 2012 to 2013. 2011, 2012, and 2013 for us to digest finished.\\nOle Slorer\\nOkay, well thanks for clarifying. And I never thought I would congratulate you on the loss making quarter, but anyway congrats and I will hand it back.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nWe sort of feel the same way.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse, your line is open.\\nJames Wicklund\\nGood morning guys. I agree with all like congratulations, it’s -- any improvement are nice improvements. Bernard last year you won this big contract in Brazil and Brazil has been just a basket case for business and investors. You got well construction and managed pressure drilling down there. Rumors are that Petrobras is going to cut another 10 rigs who knows. Can you talk about that, that’s been one of your good markets, can you talk about the risk you see in Brazil over the next year or two and the impact to Weatherford?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nIt’s a risk reality Jim. I’ll make it simple for you, we are supposed to quadruple our presence in I’ll just focus on MPD and the rest is very similar. Let's just call it going from 3 strings to 12 strings. We’ll go from 3 strings to 6 strings end of story that’s it. And this is happening this year. Otherwise the growth is not there. And so as you could imagine there was some measure of giving up of infrastructure and everything else which classic problem for oil service companies. We have to manage that. Now mind you going from 3 to 6 is better than going from 3 to 0, I am very clear. But going to 3 to 6 and 3 to 12 are two entirely different things. Rigs were cancelled simple as that.\\nJames Wicklund\\nOkay and if rigs get cancelled do we go from 6 to 3 to 0?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nNo, I think it is actually sustainable. No, it is sustainable Jim, I am giving you the end result is bad enough.\\nJames Wicklund\\nOkay, my follow up if I could Q1 Q4 somewhere in there will be the fundamental bottom. But you are still cutting people and decision was made in September to cut another 3000 people, that would make me wonder what's your trajectory is of the recovery following the bottom in Q1?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nGood question again. Look the 14,000 actually as we speak today although we’ve acted only a little bit over 12,000. Already the balance has been named so we actually it is already identified and we would probably end up a little bit higher than 14,000 by year end. So I do think that the reduction in employment exercise is coming to an end. I think what you’ll see forward are surgical actions in particular locations, particular product lines. And you see us also posing lot on the supply chain both from a procurement standpoint where there is a lot that we are doing that we never did at least not as well. And also on the manufacturing side, on the rationalizing the manufacturing side that will be less I think spectacular in terms of numbers that we announced. But much very powerful and very surgical. Also you should see us in terms of employment expanding our talent bench in certain product lines and on the contrary go in the opposite direction in other product lines.\\nUnderstanding we don’t see growth at all for the sake of growth. I mean what we really want, what you ought to focus on quarter-after-quarter is not -- you will do what you want, not so much revenue growth although we may get that too since focus on what we are trying to get done in the operating income level, at the debt reduction level, and at the cash flow levels. So, it is profitability cash flow that we’re interested in. Now next year and for the foreseeable future, it isn't necessarily the top line or put another way we want to grow aggressively certain product lines. We may not care that much about whether it translates in overall growth of the company. We may pull back from some but push much harder on others.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nWell Jim, I just want to add something, we are aggressively working on rationalizing our support structure. The remaining headcount reductions are going to be focused on support. We spoke a lot about our support ratio. We want to bring it to the mid 30s, right. We are still at 41.5, so that does not affect our ability to ramp up when activity picks up. It affects how we support that activity, how we can stretch the resources to support higher level of activity and become more efficient.\\nWhat I am saying is it is not a comment, the extra headcount reduction is not a comment on that activity is going to plummet or anything like that. It is more rationalization offer and Jim focus on one last number. We are at 41.5% support ratio and we are trying to get to 35. Bear in mind 18 months ago we were at 60. That’s right.\\nJames Wicklund\\nI think it is very hard to focus, I know.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nBear in mind they are very hard to improve your support ratio when direct coming down so softly. Much easier to improve your support ratio when direct are expanding with volume. So doing it in depression is extraordinarily hard. It is also easier from a, paying is easier for everybody to take on in the depression but it is actually mathematically much harder to get down for obvious reasons.\\nJames Wicklund\\nThank you gentlemen, appreciate it.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nThanks Jim.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from James West of Evercore ISI, your line is open.\\nJames West\\nHey, good morning gentlemen.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nGood morning James.\\nJames West\\nAnd let me -- I would also like to echo Jim in all those comments about well executed quarter. It is clear that, the things you guys do internally are really started to pay off. My first question was really on MENA, you talked about a lot of contract wins in MENA and rearranged some markets or reintroducing some product lines, are you having to give up significant pricing to get back in or is this more of hey, we are going from three to two and we want you back. Or hey, Weatherford thank you for coming back. I mean what is driving those -- the market share gains there?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nWhat's driving it I think is the lack of point which is we have a very large infrastructure that has been underutilized, that kind of no fit [ph]. We have quite large market shares and number of product lines that, the client even remembers this also, had also mentioned we are the new kid on the block. We actually have a player who has not come back and could reassume the position it once held for many, many years.\\nSo, in terms of trying to understanding who we are and what we are trying to do, it is easier than if it was a new entry, that's number one. Two, pricing; yes, of course. Pricing in general in MENA has dropped, not remotely as much as everywhere else, of course not. But we, I wouldn’t, none of the contracts and understanding, none of the contracts are major contracts, just have a lot of them and there is progress everywhere and they are stepping stones. To my knowledge none of the ones that we have incrementally in all those markets. I mean at a variance to where pricing is right now in the marketplace we are fortunate to meet pricing. I don’t think there is a variance to it.\\nThis is not actually a price components or particular difficult issue to overcome. I understand also because we have an infrastructure in place. Everything else plus the incremental operating economics are very quickly good because you don’t have to set up shop. One of the things Weatherford has, it has and I think you know this, it has a vast infrastructure internationally which was part of the reason why we spend so much CAPEX in the years past. There are other reasons too, which I think we discussed earlier on. But this infrastructure can be put to good use. And what it requires particularly internationally is volume and we are getting some volume now in MENA and therefore the economics will improve simply because of economies of scale.\\nJames West\\nOkay, that makes sense. And then Bernard you are talking about the North Sea and the Caspian being up in the fourth quarter which typically I would think about as a seasonally weak quarter for those areas given the weather issues you have faced. Is there risk to that call or are these mainly kind of product sales type actions that are going to happen regardless of adverse weather conditions?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nOkay, if weather is terrible it is only in North Sea also in Caspian, [indiscernible]. So if weather is terrible in both places, more terrible than they normally should be of course things always will be delayed is absolutely true. I don’t think the whole quarter is based on this business moving from Q3 to Q4. It is just that, incrementally it improves Q4 and incrementally weakens Q3 that's all, that's the margin.\\nIn the case of North Sea, you are talking about a series of service business actually going from one string to five strings, this is one. It is in well construction and involves a number of services inclusive of managed special drilling. From one to five it is supposed to be in Q3 and then in Q4 and it is happening as we speak, alright. Again it is not -- it is very much the same thing. Client adjourned a number of drilling and I think remediation assignments from Q3 to Q4. I don’t think oil had anything to do with it. It is just client decision. That is also happening as a matter of cost. So I will leave the whole Eastern Hemisphere will rise or fall based on movement of these contracts. I do think that it is happening as we speak notwithstanding whether it could disrupt operations and I think it is just notable because it will make Q4 the way Q3 should have been and maybe vice versa, okay.\\nJames West\\nOkay, got it. If I can slip one last one for Krishna, the 400 million in maintenance CAPEX, is that inclusive of land rigs and if you have the number for land rigs, could you share it with us?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nYes, it does include land rigs. And from a rigs business perspective our mandate to the business guys is to run the business profitably through the year and to be cash positive right through the year. And that we have achieved this year. It will continue into next year as well. Now obviously the rig utilization rate is more challenged today, than it was a year ago. So it’s quite easy to manage the maintenance CAPEX going forward and be cash positive for the year.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nIf I may add something there, we don’t take contracts particularly one involves moving rigs and unless the contracts has years and so we won't take its focus at the time because in the market which we have concentration of rigs already and have mobilization or compensation which is an offer we have not cash out of pocket to finance. So we are rather stringent about IT which also explains why rigs are not a consumer of cash.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nSorry Jim I am not going to give you a number on the call but it is going to be cash positive for the year the business. That’s the mandate and they will stay that right.\\nJames West\\nOkay and do you still have I guess sort of slip one more in here, is there still the residual to IPO that business over the next year or so when the margin comes back. I mean you are still thinking that way about the 100 business?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nJames, we are I think I’ll just say that the market has to be there. I am talking about the oil and therefore financial markets otherwise we are wasting our time. Remember we setup rigs in a separate entity. They are there on audit going back three years from our auditors KPMG. They’re there on information system segregated. They are there on the accounting system segregated. They are there on management only up to the leader and so it and they are on balance sheet if you will, if you want to peel it out its ready. Now the fact is ready is of course good. When will it be actually acted upon its really not us. It is purely activity, oil, etc. So the answer is yes, absolutely, whether it’s in a year or two years I don’t know but it is ready, yes.\\nJames West\\nOkay, got it. Thanks guys.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is open.\\nAngie Sedita\\nThanks, good morning guys. I certainly called settlement to the brothers and doesn’t need to be said again but on the cash flow when you talk about the Baird could you talk a little bit more granular about where you stand in the project, thoughts on timing in 2016, and what is left on the performance targets which is completed so far and what remains. And then also on your cash flow target for 2016, does that include any recovery from the extra claims and the change orders?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nAngie, first of all Zubair is just a term for six basically trains that we have to deliver to the customer and all -- each of the six trains is identical. Out of the six trains we finished mechanical completion for 5 of the 6 trains and handed it over to the customer. And the 6th is a mechanical completion is estimated before the end of the year. On the next two deadlines, milestones which is ready for completion RFC and then PAC which is the final deadline for the first five trains we expect RFC to be completed again before the end of the year for the first five trains with back early January of 2016. There is very little work to be done between RFC and PAC just running the facility for 30 days effectively.\\nAnd for the last site, the sixth site we expect RFC and PAC in Q1. There are milestone payments associated with achieving these milestones and these factor into the detailed cash flow projections that I spoke about earlier in my prepared comments. Now we have been conservative and assumed some sort of settlement with our customer on claims that we’ve had which are in arbitration today. We are discussing with them actively on an out of court if you will settlement. We don’t know what that number is going to be, it is still being negotiated back and forth. But there will be a positive injection into cash flow. I’ve been conservative to say that year-over-year from 2015 to 2016 Zubair will be 200 million differential cash flow positive in 2016. That’s a conservative number I am very comfortable with it based on the milestone dates and like the outcome of the settlement discussions.\\nAngie Sedita\\nOkay, that’s just really very, very helpful. And then separately or going directionally elsewhere on the U.S. and pricing, can you talk about obviously pressure pumping is ugly on the pricing side but as far as pricing in your other segments in Q3, your product lines artificial lift completion what are you seeing there, can you talk about your other product lines across the spectrum?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nI think the short answer Angie is that although you have had instances of going both ways for the most part excluding pressure pumping and rentals, I think pricing is essentially flattened, bottomed across the Board. There are few trends here and there but on balance it is correct. If you want something on the positive side as evidenced in official list on the one hand we ourselves coming to the end of our selling inventories which were from a cost perspective and the higher cost structure than we are able to manufacture today. So that is one issue which is positive for us meaning that everything being equal you end up having higher margins on the same sale. We expect that to start occurring in Q1. Not in Q4 but in Q1.\\nAt the same time there is evidence of the clients destocking. In another words they finished their destocking programs, and officially if you need to use up the equipment by and large and there are exceptions Angie but by and large used equipment, pumps and pumping units and all manners of tools that are involved in official list process. As evidenced that on average our clients are efficiently stocking. So put all that together which is from a cost perspective you have improvements just naturally from our side simply from having liquidated by year-end the higher cost inventory which we’re hosting on the market, I would disciplined. And at the same time clients having to buy more because their inventory has been liquidated. I would say actually that is already occurring right now. So we’d say certainly by year-end possibly already by Q4.\\nSo that sort of factor which is significant for us but overall pricing with the exception of pressure pumping and perhaps rental tools but pressure pumping even more so, I think the rest in pricing and at least we can observe in North America is sitting on the low which is not weakening further. These are my observation.\\nAngie Sedita\\nPerfect, thanks. I’ll turn it over.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from Sean Meakim of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\\nSean Meakim\\nHey, good morning.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nGood morning Sean.\\nSean Meakim\\nSo just in a similar range, you talked a lot about the smaller competitors in pressure pumping and their cash flow stress and we look at some of the other product lines we just going through, a lift rentals thing like that are you seeing smaller folks exit the market, is the competitive landscape shifting at all as you go through the downturn?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nIt is really a -- I think it’s a legitimate -- whole question is legitimate but strategically legitimate questions rentals and pressure pumping. So yes, we see small players that are either going out of business or come down such low level of utilization that it is just not the same thing. Do not hold much hope though because of barriers to entry in both those product lines is still low. We do not subscribe to the notion that equivalent to that fact does not come back, doesn’t agree with at all. Truly equivalent to the fact whether its rental equipment or pressure pumping was even a bigger problem would require some refurbishment. Refurbishment is a fraction of the replacement cost. And then one of the problems of those two businesses and clearly were the ones to be emphasizing because again we are not interested particularly in size, interested in profitability and cash contribution now and later. Well bigger problem with those product lines is the barrier to entry is so low. Now you can excel at it from an efficiency standpoint. There are some technologies that are helpful but by and large it has got very low barriers to entry and that’s not going to change. So I don’t see although there are smaller players that are being pushed out and so forth they will be coming back. I don’t doubt that on the different ownership. It does not imply to artificial lift up. Because the lift is not at all the case, that’s entirely different.\\nSean Meakim\\nThat’s very helpful and then just on international where do you think we are in terms of the cycle for pricing pressure, how should we think about how to look just down turn to the prior one?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner\\nSo let's be careful. International facilities, lot of different regions. The other thing I would say is segregate it also what markets in terms of the types of environment you are drilling in. I mean deepwater is going to be different from offshore, it is going to be different from land. If land got hit early and got hit bad I think land in general with maybe exceptions in Latin America from a pricing standpoint is essentially dull. I think the pain that is coming internationally will be primarily in deepwater. Deepwater economics I am told by a number of clients in simplistic terms doesn’t work below $70 rent. Now it is still really simplistic. Obviously it just doesn’t work and so that all expect exploration and deepwater to be hit bad and therefore pricing clearly will deteriorate there for whomever is playing in those markets and all of us are to varying degrees.\\nOther than Latin America in simplistic terms I think you are down on pricing by and large. There may be some pockets of weaknesses still in Latin America I don’t believe that many. And I don’t have -- and actually offshore as in -- not that different I think from land also. It’s really deepwater exploration I think where the bulk of the volume declines unless oil corrects quickly, volume declines and therefore pricing associated with whatever is left in terms of business will be the harshest to go through now.\\nAnd don’t make what I am about to say to a badge of Obama but this isn't a market exploration we don’t play and the deepwater we do play but it is not our strongest market at all, never was. As you know we are land people and to a degree shop people.\\nSean Meakim\\nThat’s very helpful detail, thank you.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\\nKurt Hallead\\nGreat, thank you, good morning. You guys went and threw a lot of good stuff and detail here. I was just wondering on the free cash flow dynamic if you can pass out a bit more on working capital and maybe refresh some of the targets you might have for receivables and inventory, etc?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nWell, every quarter this year we’ve generated positive cash flow from working capital and it will not change in Q4. Q4 is usually a pretty decent quarter for customer actions Kurt. So DSO we expect will certainly reduce from Q3 to Q4 as it did during Q3 as well with the focus we are putting on it. Inventory continues to go down with the focus we are putting on it. I think Bernard talked about artificial lift, he is talking on our side that has been the real focus for us as of the other product lines completions included. So inventory should reduce nicely in fact over the next two or three quarters I would say continuously until we hit some activity inflection at some point in 2016. Those are the two big movers we are working at. I think there is no reasons for us to believe that we cannot continue to generate -- if the activity at revenue level is flattened then yes, I mean at some point the working capital will start to flatten as well. But then earnings will increase dramatically with incrementals that will help us quite a lot given the factors I mentioned earlier. So they will balance off against each other.\\nKurt Hallead\\nOkay, that’s great, I appreciate that explanation. And then the comments you made about maintenance CAPEX and levels of maintenance CAPEX needed and the duration of which you can operate effectively, is that the game plan for 2016 to operate at maintenance CAPEX or is that just a reference point in a very extreme situation?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nSo it’s a game plan and it is not only the game plan for 2016 it is also the game plan at the current moment we are looking at 2017. It is just based on how much excessive footprint we have around the world across all product lines. So you would have to see an incredible activity increase to mop that up quicker than 2017. So it is a game plan and it is very achievable.\\nKurt Hallead\\nOkay and then one last thing then as it relates to the comments you made about the debt and the covenants and everything else I just want to make sure I understood the point you are trying to make in your minds based on your financial position and the conservations you may be having with some of the creditors. You are of the view point that you’re rating for your debt should not remain unchanged, is that how we should understand your comments?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nI think the rating agencies will take a view on the sector as a whole and if they take a draconian view of the sector I think every company in the sector will be re-rated and we are just investment grade today. So, I would not hold my breath and say we are going to retain that for the longest time. If they changed the ratings in all the companies within the sector certainly we will be affected by it. But the impact of that will not be material at all on Weatherford as I explained earlier. So, it definitely it doesn’t affect us dramatically.\\nKurt Hallead\\nOkay, that is fantastic. Thanks so much.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nIn terms of covenants by the way I went through the entire calculation in quite a lot of detail Kurt because if you just take a facile calculation from our 10-Q balance sheet you could reach very quickly very wrong conclusions. And I just wanted to make sure people understood that the covenant is a defined, it is a definition, it is a negotiated term in our contract and that is what I was trying to explain. Something that is not obvious from our 10-Q filings.\\nKurt Hallead\\nGot it, thank you so much.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nAnd by the way the covenant is only on the revolver, it is not on any of our public debt which is bulk anyway.\\nKurt Hallead\\nOkay, got it. Thank you.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nThanks.\\nKaren David-Green\\nWell thank you all very much for joining us today. We will conclude the call at this time. Lori if you could provide the replay information.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\",\n",

       "  \"Operator\\nGood morning, my name is Laurie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Weatherford International Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Karen David-Green, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Marketing and Communications. You may begin your conference.\\nKaren David-Green\\nThank you, Laurie, good morning and welcome to the Weatherford International fourth quarter conference call. With me on today's call from Geneva we have Bernard Duroc-Danner, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Krishna Shivram, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Weatherford's website for 10 days.\\nBefore we begin with our opening comments I'd like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our fourth quarter press release that can be found on our website for the customary caution on forward-looking statements and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now I'd like to hand the call over to Krishna.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nThank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a brief recap of our operating performance in the fourth quarter. Loss per share for the quarter before charges and credits was $0.13. Revenue of $2.01 billion for the quarter decreased 10% sequentially and 46% year on year. Operating income margins before R&D and corporate expenses declined by 255 basis points sequentially to 2.8%. Excluding the rigs business our core business revenue decreased 9% sequentially with a 115 basis point deterioration in operating income margins to 3.9%. These margins do not benefit from any of the asset or other impairment charges recorded this quarter as these impairments were accounted as of December 31. In other words, the margins reflect the tightly run operations and cost management actions, something Bernard will touch on later.\\nNorth America revenue declined 15% sequentially, in line with the reduction in rig count coupled with continued pricing pressures with operating income margins dipping 312 basis points to negative 9.6%. International revenue reduced sequentially by 4.9%, marginally better than each of our larger peers, while operating income margins decreased slightly by 80 basis points to 12.1%. Eastern Hemisphere results were resilient in the face of activity and pricing reductions with revenue dipping only 2% sequentially, comfortably beating our peers, while margins improved 20 basis points to remain steady at 10.6%.\\nIn Latin America revenue declined 11% and margins dropped by 245 basis points to 15.2%, reflecting client led spending cuts in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico coupled with our self-imposed reductions in activity in Venezuela and Ecuador. In the Europe/Caspian/Russia/sub-Sahara Africa region, revenue was down 7% reflecting seasonal winter declines in Russia and the North Sea, coupled with project cancellations across sub-Sahara Africa principally in Angola, while margins remain resilient at 11.4% as proactive cost management offset the impact of revenue declines.\\nThe revenue in the Middle East and Asia Pacific region grew 2% with a 64 basis point improvement in margins to 10%, with advances in Kuwait, China, Indonesia, Oman, Malaysia and Abu Dhabi more than offsetting declines in Iraq. Overall margins were positively impacted by our continued proactive cost management actions across all the regions. Our Land Drilling Rigs business recorded a 22% sequential revenue decline with the end of several drilling projects across the Middle East and North Africa region, mainly in Chad, Kuwait and India. The rigs business slipped to an operating loss of $17 million as cost reduction actions were not quick enough to stem the loss of revenue.\\nBelow operating margins R&D costs reduced by $4 million while corporate costs were flat. Our budget for 2016 comprises cutting nonessential projects to reduce R&D spend to $150 million for the full year. Corporate costs will also be reduced to $150 million for the year.\\nThe tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter reflected the tax benefit on the losses in the U.S., partly offset by tax provisions internationally where we continue to be profitable. The tax rate for 2016 will be dependent on the geographical mix of earnings and will be heavily weighted by results in the U.S.\\nThe fourth quarter results include after-tax charges of $1.1 billion which includes impairment of asset and inventory carrying values, mainly in the United States, in the pressure pumping and rental tool businesses due to the low activity levels. In addition, several international rigs which are idle and not likely to sign contracts in the foreseeable future, were also impaired. The bulk of these charges are non-cash in nature and reflect the difficult operating conditions of the current down cycle.\\nWe also conducted our normal annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter. As always, a detailed analysis was prepared in consultation with external experts and this analysis was stringently tested. The conclusion was that there was no impairment of goodwill.\\nGiven the sudden deterioration of commodity prices most recently and as a matter of abundant caution, we updated our projections and analysis and retested the goodwill for potential impairment. Again the conclusion was that there was no impairment of goodwill.\\nMoving on to net debt and cash flow now, net debt reduced by $191 million to reach $6.994 billion at the end of the year. This was the first time our net debt has dipped below $7 billion since March 2011. Free cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $168 million resulting in a positive full-year free cash flow number of $129 million.\\nCapEx in the fourth quarter was high at $140 million, about $32 million higher than previously forecast. In order to preserve key vendor relationships we took and paid for deliveries from vendors that had been delayed for several quarters. Cash severance costs paid in Q4 amounted to $43 million which was $23 million higher than anticipated, mainly as a result of quicker execution of our headcount reduction program. Without these two cash overruns our free cash flow for Q4 would have been $223 million. Both items will benefit free cash flow in 2016.\\nWorking capital generated $250 million of liquidity this quarter and $567 million for the year, with strong customer collections and a lower yearend DSO compared with any of our peers, coupled with a significant drop in inventory balances of $743 million for the year.\\nThe Zubair project was cash positive in the fourth quarter as several milestones were achieved triggering cash payments as per contract. Overall at the company level this was the first time we have generated positive free cash flow for the full year since 2010 in spite of much more challenging business conditions. As of December 31, available liquidity was $1.7 billion, meaning we have a large borrowing cushion available to us.\\nI would now like to offer a view on free cash flow in 2016. We expect to generate between $600 million and $700 billion of free cash flow in 2016, taking our net debt at the end of this year well below $6.5 billion and a targeted net debt level of below $6 billion by the end of 2017. Our long term net debt target is $4 billion which will get nearer when we sell the rigs business once market conditions improve.\\nThere are four key variables that give us enough confidence to protect free cash flow at between $600 million and $700 million for 2016. The first variable is the net cash flow from the Zubair EPF contract in Iraq. As of today, all of six trains have achieved mechanical completion and five of the six trains have achieved the next milestone RFC or ready for commissioning, milestone. We have also successfully introduced hydrocarbons in three of the trains.\\nWe now have a clear line of sight on the final milestones which will trigger additional contractual payments. We also expect to reach a settlement on change order claims after contract completion. As 2015 was a net cash flow negative year for this project, the year-over-year swing is expected to be in the range of $200 million.\\nThe second key variable is cash severance and restructuring cost. In 2015 we spent $193 million in cash. In 2016, given the reduced level of headcount reduction of 6,000 versus 14,000, we expect to not exceed $80 million, meaning that year on year we will have an improvement of about $110 million.\\nThe third key variable is capital expenditure. Based on the quantity of excess equipment we carry at year end, we do not envisage any growth CapEx for 2016 even if activity levels increase. As a result of the acceleration of CapEx spend into Q4 of 2015 with a higher acceptance of [indiscernible] deliveries; we have reduced the CapEx budget for $2016 to $300 million which is roughly the maintenance CapEx level we need for the estimated operating activity levels. If activity levels reduce further we have the ability to dial back CapEx even more.\\nOn the back of reducing CapEx by 53% in 2015 versus 2014, we have developed a strong review and approval process which forces equipment sharing and intensifies utilization. The value of approved but unspent AFEs going into 2016 is 81% lower than 12 months ago which should allow us to comfortably meet the $300 million target.\\nFinally, the last key variable is inventory. Despite a relatively large pipeline of vendor orders coming into 2015 from 2014, we managed to reduce inventory balances by $743 million in 2015. Our target for 2016 is to reduce inventory balances by a further $550 million, generating cash in the process.\\nWith a low vendor order pipeline going into 2016 which is 66% lower in value compared with 12 months ago and a systematic process to approve new orders while encouraging sharing among locations, we believe this target can be achieved with relative ease. These four variables, namely the Zubair contract, cash severance cost, CapEx and inventory reductions, are factors within our control and relatively independent of business conditions.\\nWhen you at the impact of these four variables together, the incremental cash flow in 2016 versus 2015 is about $500 million. We're confident that variations in earnings and accounts receivable should nullify each other. Given the free cash flow for 2015 was $129 million, adding the $500 million on the key variables will provide - that the key variables will provide allow us to realistically target a free cash flow goal of between $600 billion and $700 million in 2016.\\nWe believe that the free cash flow performance in 2015, the available liquidity at year end and the expected free cash flow number for 2016 should allow access to more than enough cash to repay both the maturity of $350 million this month and the June 2017 debt maturity of $600 million.\\nI would now like to update you on our short term credit facilities. You will remember that our current facility expires in July 2017. Having said that, it is good practice to proactively address the replacement of this facility early, we will launch a new facility shortly after this earnings call, maintaining the overall size at $2.25 billion, but extending the facility out over the next three to four years.\\nWe have ongoing discussions with our bank group with respect to the terms and conditions of such an extended facility and we're confident we can conclude this new facility by the end of the first quarter. Also, purely as a measure of abundant precaution and mostly to reassure our equity holders, we have successfully renegotiated the covenant on our current revolving credit facility from a 60% debt to cap ratio to a 70% ratio. At the end of the year the calculated debt to cap ratio, including the extraordinary asset and inventory impairment charges taken in Q4, is 55.6%. This includes a $1.6 billion adjustment for the accumulated currency impact on nonmonetary non-U.S. dollar assets.\\nAs previously mentioned, all our assets, including goodwill, were tested stringently for impairment in Q4, resulting in an after-tax charge of $1.1 billion. Without this impairment charge the covenant calculation would have been 51.4% which is slightly better compared to the third quarter. Nevertheless, the newly negotiated covenant of 70% leaves ample headroom of about $2.8 billion to trigger the new covenant. This means that there is no realistic possibility of a covenant breach.\\nWe enjoy an excellent working relationship with our banking group and this is evidenced by the unanimous acceptance of the recent change in our debt to cap covenant. We anticipate no difficulty in renegotiating and extending out our short term financing facility. I would like to also remind you that our long term bonds totaling $5.8 billion at year end represent 77% of our total debt and do not carry any debt to cap or any other ratio driven covenants. With that I will now turn the call over to Bernard.\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nThank you, Krishna and good morning, everyone. It is difficult to describe a quarter in which we remain unprofitable and with large asset impairment as successful, but operationally it was. The obsessive focus and discipline on core, cost, cash is paying dividends and will continue to do so. Our direction won't move an inch. The drive and intensity will only increase.\\nDecrementals are a good metric of operational performance. Decrementals overall were 28.1% on 10% sequential decline in revenues. Without rigs the core decrementals were 16.6% on 9% declined revenues which is just about best in class.\\nOur performance was a tale of two hemispheres. The Eastern Hemisphere was essentially flat both on revenues and operating income which is best in class. We gained share in a wide cross-section of the Hemisphere and stringent cost cuts of prior quarters helped. Both factors made up for continued market erosion and severe pricing pressures which are widespread in the Eastern Hemisphere.\\nThe Eastern Hemisphere is a growing area of relative strength for Weatherford. The revenues and profitability declines occurred in Western Hemisphere, both NAM and Latin America. North America did markedly better than Latin America. North America reported a 15% decline in revenues but held the decrementals to 10.9%.\\nThe outstanding decrementals are a reflection of structural changes brought about in the operations. North America has been entirely reorganized and transformed. Its costs, operating practices and talent benched forged a new operation. The results of the prior four quarter's relentless drive.\\nLatin America stood out as the low performer with a 10.6% decline in revenues and a punitive 38.4% detrimental. The explanation was in part a further market weakening in Colombia and Brazil, but by far the larger factor was a self-imposed reduction in activity in Venezuela and Ecuador. Venezuela alone was half the quarterly revenue decline and more than all the profitability decline.\\nBy contrast, Argentina and some of the smaller regional markets continue to grow. Put another way, Latin America's Q4 reflect primarily self-imposed discipline more so than performance. In fact, without our Venezuela and Ecuador purposeful pullback the region would have shown level profitability on Q3 or slightly up, very much like Eastern Hemisphere.\\nTaking stock of the full-year 2015, two markers of how much the company has changed and performed. The year-on-year 2015 on 2014 operating income decrementals were held at 28.1% on 36.7% revenue declines. This is ignoring the effects of foreign exchange on revenues, incidentally. By comparison 2009 on 2008 decrementals were 153.6%.\\nSecond, in a year of massive decline and reduction in force, Weatherford achieved its highest metric for employee safety worldwide in its recorded history. Safety achievements are seldom compatible with the disruptions of retrenchment. The safety is a proxy for quality and reliability.\\nI will focus the rest of my comments on three areas, further operating underpinnings of the Q4 results; forward views and our direction; and the endpoint for transformation of the company. Operation underpinnings of Q4 - rather than a superficial oversight of all regions in Q4, I want to provide granularity on North America as an illustration of the transformation of Weatherford. I'll focus more specifically on the U.S. while the same commentary could be made on the Canadian operations.\\nNAM's outstanding decremental performance was earned through the systematic transformation of our operating organization. The driving factors were - cost cuts; we were early and we went deep and we didn't pause. Yearend 2015 versus yearend 2014 we lowered our payroll and headcount by 41%. This quarter in Q1 we're taking down another 15% of our U.S. headcount, meaning that from January 1, 2015 to date or just about 15 months at the end of Q1, we'll have lowered our U.S. headcount and payroll by 50%.\\nWhat we addressed goes beyond lowering headcount. We delayered the organization, rationalized facilities infrastructure and upgraded the talent bench both internally and through outside hires. Specifically we rationalized the infrastructure with a total of 126 facility closures. There's another 25 or so scheduled for Q1. We went from seven sub regions to three and we moved from five reporting operating layers from regional leaders to the well site to an average of three.\\nBeyond the payroll reduction numbers it is the structure and the culture of operations which has been fundamentally changed. The other thing we worked on is product line focus. Close to half of the sequential revenue decline in Q4 for NAM was with pressure pumping and drilling tools, otherwise known as rentals. This decline was one of choice; we purposefully scaled back operations for those two product lines and therefore share.\\nBy all measurement we continue to gain share steadily in our other product lines which is the intent here - for here and now and highly desirable long term. The stark reality that with our pressure pumping NAM in Q4 will be close to profitable even in this deep depression. In fact, with our pressure pumping and drilling tools which together combined in Q4 still add up to about 20% of our NAM revenues, NAM will be profitable and compared to the operating income margins of our larger peer group.\\nIn both cases the pressure pumping and rigs tools, there are essentially no barriers to entry, vast over supply of equipment and unsustainably punitive economics. We won't pursue contracts that have punitive returns, we don't have to and we won't; we would rather let others do so.\\nWe're doing fundamental efficiency work in the U.S. addressing the structural as well as the cyclical and the talent bench. The U.S. will be a transformed operation when we're finished, should expect this trend to continue in the first half of this year. We're ready to address any market conditions both to manage down decrementals in the event of further market declines in the first half of 2016 and exploit large incremental gains when the recovery comes.\\nWe're in the midst of the same operating changes internationally as we have effected in NAM. You should expect the same results which brings me to the outlook for the first half of 2016 - or the outlook for 2016 altogether.\\nThe overall market and [indiscernible] results will be weaker in Q1 than in Q4 in both NAM and the international markets. First, seasonality suggests a lower Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America and is always the case in the first quarter.\\nSecond are the consequences of oil pricing. We will experience in all markets further volume declines and pricing pressures. We're ready for this. We're addressing both with continuing to aggressively managing down our cost structure and a very focused product line strategy by geographic market.\\nAssuming $25 to $30 average pricing for the first half of the year, that is for oil of course, we believe our Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America operations will trough in Q1. We expect Eastern Hemisphere to seasonally recover some in Q2. Latin America will also, but it will be a slower and more pained recovery. Still, international in our judgment will trough in Q1 and we expect Eastern Hemisphere to remain in Q2 and there on an island of relative strength for the balance of the year.\\nThe rig operations will see modest improvements in financial results most likely by late Q2 there on. By midyear a number of stacked rigs will have been mobilized on location and operating. This will lead to better results for the second half of the year. Our rig operations remain segregated from the core in management, operations, IT and financial results all the way to separate audits. They remain a non-core asset which we nonetheless manage very carefully. They will be divested when market conditions improve, the proceeds will be used to further delever the company.\\nLastly, we have set as an internal target to reach earnings breakeven by Q3 based on cuts in 2016 and carryover from 2015 as well as Eastern Hemisphere performance. This will be a hard objective to achieve given what we expect the marketplace, but one we believe is achievable. Free cash flow remains an unyielding priority. The range of free cash flow for 2016, as Krishna mentioned, will be $600 million to $700 million. Net debt by year end will decline to well under $6.5 billion. The objective is well understood, planned for and prioritized by all in the organization, both financial and operations. We will deliver this level of free cash flow.\\nOur direction is clear to all within Weatherford. We're changing the rules of engagement in all of our business dealings. We're focused on core cost cash, we build on our operating progress to date with more efficiency, cash discipline, systematic talent upgrades and selected market share focus. We delever at the balance sheet through free cash flow quarter after quarter with no exceptions and eventually with more divestments. This is our direction.\\nOur action centers around improving four things and doing so in a perennial way. Lower cost structure through cycles, capital allocation and cash generation as a companywide discipline, leapfrog talent bench and talent development as a culture focused on quality and reliability for all product lines.\\nI will summarize some of the accomplishments in 2015 and the work in progress for 2016. Reduction in force, reduce our payroll overall by 41% over 2014 and 2015. As a reminder, we had 67,400 employees on January 1, 2014; 55,400 on January 1, 2015; and we stand at 39,500 employees at year end 2015. We will reduce our employment further by 6,000 positions to 33,500; this will get done in Q1 and completed before the end of Q2.\\nWe took down our support ratio from 59% in 2014 to where it presently stands at 38.0%. A 21% decline in support ratio is a colossal structural change in record time. To do this during a cyclical downturn is doubly difficult. It is also a structural change that will provide us with outsized incremental margins through the recovery years. We'll push down further our support ratio to 35%.\\nOperations will streamline with consolidation of geographic segments, flattening of the reporting organization, scaling down regional headquarters and push the country closer to the sand face. Supply chain initiated a two-year restructuring of productivity leapfrog; manufacturing, logistics and procurement are in the midst of a fundamental productivity and efficiency change. This is an economic breakthrough for our operating cost structure and flexibility of adjustment to changes in business volumes.\\nNow here comes a synthesis of all the work done in 2015 on the cost side. So acted upon cost cuts in 2015 add up to $984 million cost cuts in headcount and $402 million in supply chain and facility closures. We add them together that is in total $1.386 billion of which just over half has been realized in 2015 because of timing. The full balance or roughly $650 million, will accrue 2016 results.\\nMoving over to the balance sheet, inventory declined by about $600 million before any book impairment. We expect similar reduction of inventories in 2016. We remain long equipment and inventories as we enter 2016. Receivables are run with the tightest control. You will find that our Q4 and year end DSO's are best in class amongst our peers.\\nAs Krishna mentioned, CapEx was cut by 55% in 2015 to $650 million; we will take them down to $300 million in 2016. And R&D will be cut by 35% from $230 million to $150 million, preserving only essential technological research. With the exception of R&D which can be caught up quickly with a recovery, we're not cutting into muscle. We entered the depression with a large pool of excess equipment and heavy organizational structure. Much of what we're doing is as much perennial efficiency transformation than volume-related direct cost adjustments.\\nAnd we're continuously adding muscle by high grading our talents. We're, in fact, constantly acting our new hires into now internal promotions for operating positions worldwide to strengthen our bench. This also reaches out to senior operating management levels. By the end of Q1 we will bring on as an officer a new leader for our product lines to complete the senior operating team.\\nProduct lines require a number of focal points with the most critical centering around quality and reliability. At the other end of the spectrum, this year we're hiring upwards of 500 new graduates from engineering schools around the world. It is an ongoing commitment which we will do in good and in bad years, they are the future of the company.\\nWeatherford is in the midst of a transformation from cost structure, cooperating practices and quality focus, returns objectives and a culture of sales, we're a completely different company in the making. Our performance in this trough through the first half 2016 will bear this out on all metrics. Our performance and recovery will surprise to the upside. Our incrementals will stand out like our decrementals did.\\nOur synthesis - a word about the macro, the oil industry, as you know, is massively underfunded and massively underinvested. It defies the imagination what is going on in reservoirs around the world. Pessimism rules in all aspects of analysis and interpretation. Yet if current oil pricing and oil selectivity endure, the industry will not be able to manage required oil demand as early as 2017. This means oil demand would not be met by existing oil capacity.\\nExisting oil capacity just about equates to existing production rates. Inventory overhang will help; but by definition that isn't more than a stopgap solution. All this is a physical fact or - even though it has no effect on the psychology of oil pricing and forward curve.\\nThe black swan issue is a possibility of a worldwide recession which would abruptly arrest the growth in oil demand. There is much focus on the sustainability of GNP growth rates in the various countries particularly all important China. And obviously worldwide recession would adjourn all considerations oilfield recovery for the duration of the recession.\\nTo the extent though there are no apparent factors that could precipitate a domino effect of country recessions and there is a web of stimulating counterbalancing factors, the obsessive focus from an oil standpoint ends up being on whether demand growth in 2016 will be 1 million barrels a day or 1.5 million barrels a day or anything in between. Those are important differences but they pale in comparison to the gathering storm of decline in production akin to declines in capacity. Other than a few barrels came from Iran. By our assessment the industry has no spare capacity beyond the present operating rates.\\nFurthermore, elasticity of supply response is being ignored or overstated. In my 30 years in the oilfields and my prior years watching my father operate in same, I have never seen anything like it. At one level it is unthinkable; at another those are the choices made by market economy in response to geopolitical decisions. But even the latter will become soon enough academic when supply curve crosses demand on its way down with no immediate or obvious short term solutions to address it.\\nIt isn't all bad. The present state of industry depression offers us great opportunities. We're positioning Weatherford in a very focused industry segment, deemphasizing or exiting others, using our product line strength, infrastructure and specific technological leadership. We're using the brutal recession to fundamentally change our cost structure, quality, efficiency, returns culture and emphatically our talent bench.\\nThis is a unique opportunity for us to make a quantum change, keeping what is good and promising at Weatherford, but fundamentally changing what wasn't. We're today already a very different company. Our operating and management capabilities are immeasurably stronger than they historically were. We have still a worldwide infrastructure of service support second to none.\\nWe're confident of our technological strength, product line breadth and market potential for organic growth. And finally, paramount to us in bad and good markets, we maintain a strong free cash flow and that will not change. Our numbers will prove out the merits of our direction in this brutal down cycle and just as much when the market turns. Our direction will deliver high shareholder returns at the lowest risk and this direction will not change.\\nWith that I will turn the call to the operator for Q&A.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is open.\\nBill Herbert\\nKrishna, could you run through the components of the free cash flow generation in 2016? Because it seems like you arrived at a $500 million number plus adding the $150 million thereabouts for 2015 to get to $650 million.\\nWhen I think you said Zubair $200 million year-over-year positive delta for free cash flow, severance and restructuring severely reduced in 2016 versus 2015, so that is $110 million. Capital spending down $380 million. And then I thought you said inventory reduction of $550 million but then you - those four buckets you arrived at a net free cash flow increase of $500 million. Am I missing something or no?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nYes, Bill, basically I am saying that inventory will come down $550 million, but inventory came down in 2015 by $750 million. So, the net between the two years is lower liquidity from inventory by about $200 million. So that is your missing piece, all that you get $500 million and then you add the $129 million, we're very comfortable between the $600 million and $700 million number.\\nBill Herbert\\n$129 million, got it. And then the February debt maturity, that gets paid out of your credit facility or what?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nYes, it is going to be paid out of our credit facility next week.\\nBill Herbert\\nAnd the amendments to your covenants and the extension of your credit facility, what does that do to your cost debt?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nWell, that is to be determined. We're going to work with our bankers in the next six weeks to put in place a longer term credit facility, as I said. And there will be the customary type of slew of guarantees and securities that are commensurate with our credit rating and the cost will be marginally higher. But it is not going to be material to Weatherford's results. We're talking in the - probably in the $10 million to $20 million annual range. So it is not really material.\\nBill Herbert\\nAnd then Bernard, back to your outlook, assuming that essentially when you roll up kind of national oil company and large natural resource holder international capital spending declines 2016, it seems as if - at least the early indications point to a 20% reduction year over year. Juxtapose sort of Weatherford's revenue performance against that benchmark, if you will. Why would it be better, why would it be worse, why would it be in line?\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nFirst, if you just look at 20% decline, our rough judgment would be that we'd probably, just in terms of national share gains, pick up about half of the decline. In other words, if it is down 20% we'll probably be down 10%. This is the first judgment. Why? Simply because we have low market shares in a number of places which we're gradually inching back.\\nThis is a continuation of what we have done. It really happens in the Eastern Hemisphere, happens in Latin America, ex-Venezuela and Ecuador which we in essence we're not - we have a very, very small presence in and will keep it small.\\nThe other factor and when we look at our assessment for 2016, is not a top-line factor, it is a cost factor. In reading the prepared comments it's always hard to be able to highlight the parts that are particularly useful. But when we count everything that we have done in 2015 and we're very honest about it, we have just under $1.4 billion of measurable - I mean really measurable cost action, $1.385 billion, exactly.\\nAnd we know that only just about $730 million were actually realized as we went through the P&L in 2015. So maybe it was the timing of these things. So we got a little over $650 million on the cost side which have been acted upon that are coming in now in January and February, etc., in 2016. And we're taking further actions as we're taking down 6,000 people more companywide and some more actions around supply chain.\\nSo the point being that a combination of natural share gains that are nothing spectacular, they are just - they are, at the end the dollars are not that large so we're not that large of a company at the end of the day. But in a number of areas we have unnaturally low market share.\\nSo it is sort of a quite easy to gain if only because in the areas we specialize in we have good performance. And then you have that and then you have simply a very strong tailwind which is on the cost side, probably stronger than just about any other company's because we have been obsessive about it and we had more to cut.\\nBill Herbert\\nRight. And the three markets, if memory serves with regard to your market share gains where you have essentially been marginalized or, for whatever reason, not nearly as active as you have been historically. Saudi, Algeria and Angola, are those the three?\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nYes, yes, I think you have - first of all it is Middle East are the primary ones. Not only the Middle East, but you have got pockets also in SSA, you are absolutely correct and you are spot on. You also have certain areas of Asia-Pacific also which is a very, very difficult market. I am not minimizing the difficulty of the market, it is quite the contrary. But within difficult markets you can have relative performance. And also we had very, very presence in Asia-Pacific in a few markets. I will tell you the management that we have in the field is - and I hope they are listening to this call - is immensely more talented than they ever were.\\nSo the drive in Asia-Pacific, the drive in the Middle East, just to name those two and also some other areas in the Eastern Hemisphere here and there, is [indiscernible] get back or get at least some market share and then we can. And the product lines are what you would expect, including services or formation evaluation, completion of course and well construction more so than lift.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\nOle Slorer\\nKrishna, just to clarify on the cost of - clearly most of the questions we get on most companies right now are centered around the balance sheet and financing and sustainability. So, sorry about getting back to that. But the $10 million to $20 million you specify, was that to do with the cost of changing the covenant from 60% to 70% or was it a total cost of that and what you expect to be the case on the $2.25 billion facility extension?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nNo, it is anticipated increase in cost for the extension we're talking about. There was hardly any cost for the change from 60% to 70%, miniscule. So it is a range, okay, that is in our minds. But it has to be still negotiated and nailed down with the banking group. And we feel very comfortable that we will be able to do so.\\nOle Slorer\\nOkay, so you are comfortable that you can extend and incur an incremental cost within $10 million to $20 million. I think that would be a great relief for a lot of us. And when it comes to the cash flow, to what extent will the $500 million be backend loaded? Do you see any chance that you will be free cash flow positive in the first quarter?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nWe will be marginally free cash flow positive in the first quarter. As you know, first quarter is always seasonally challenged not only from a results standpoint but also from a cash flow standpoint. As customers, mainly national oil company customers, they typically slow down payments to operating companies, to service companies and this year is no exception. And also you have a kind of a lot of payment for the prior year bonuses for employees and all the rest of it. Working capital does take a little bit of a hickey in the first quarter which is seasonal.\\nSo, I do expect to be marginally cash flow positive in Q1 and then building up as the year goes on. If you look at our history, Q1 has always been the most challenged free cash flow quarter and this year is going to be no exception with the one difference being that we expect to be marginally positive.\\nOle Slorer\\nWell, that would be a very strong start if you can do that. Just finally, Bernard, just your thoughts on Iran, if you could share what opportunity you see for the international service industry or your kind of high-level thoughts on what can be easily done in Iran with respect to export capacity.\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nLook, the capacity that Iran can operate at circles around 3.5 million barrels a day. Just before the opening of the markets, best of my knowledge, they were around 3.15 million giving a swing of 350,000 barrels a day. Then you get into issues of grade of oil and I wouldn't even belabor the point because there are issues of marketability of the oil. So that is 350,000 barrels looking for a home. Now it is also true that the 350,000 barrels a day is not really available from a production capacity. It will require a few months just to - because that 3.5 million barrels a day capacity is not truly functional, but it will be functional shortly.\\nMore interestingly - that is actually a very, very small number. More interestingly to go above 3.5 million barrels a day for the next 500,000 barrels a day to the best of my knowledge - and I don't have a bias either ways, neither optimistic nor pessimistic, just realistic - you are talking at about not far from a couple of years, regardless of public pronouncements, to go from 3.5 million to 4 million. So if you want to be reasonable I think you could get there by the end of next year.\\nAnd I would also say that given the nature of the reservoirs, their size, the level of fractionation that they have, their vintage or exploitation, I would say that my particular view and it is not my own - I am not the only one to have that view - is that on and around 4 million barrels a day Iran is capped. Iran is above all a gigantic gas cap, it is above all an issue of gas. Gas is an entirely different discussion for Iran.\\nI mean very quickly, the time and attention and the capital and so forth and so on will be moved to gas and then oil will be an issue trying to keep production capacity in that range of 3.4 million to 4 million. Iran is not an oil issue, Iran is a gas issue and that is where the money is for them. And ultimately for the oilfield service industry will also be where the money will be made, it is all supporting the gas development, but that is a very long term discussion.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\\nJim Wicklund\\nKrishna, thanks for so directly addressing some of the issues around debt. Like both Bill and Ole have said, the questions we get are on debt as much as equity these days. But the details about the debt to impairments and a good job on the 70%. Guys, when is Zubair going to actually be finished? I mean like done and we don't talk about it anymore?\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nIs actually not in our hands; it is in the hands of the client. We really fundamentally are waiting for oil to be able to put it through the facility. The scope and scale of the work we're doing is now down to almost skeleton. Now as we finish the work we're waiting just for the hydrocarbons and running through the facilities for 90 days and that is it. So we're just waiting on the hydrocarbons is the answer provided by the client, not by us.\\nJim Wicklund\\nOkay. But that is going to be this year you think?\\nKrishna Shivram\\nYes.\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nYes. I mean, look, if it is not we would beyond the scope of the contract completely. We're looking at between Q1 and depending on when the hydrocarbons [indiscernible] Q1 or early Q2.\\nJim Wicklund\\nI just wanted to hear you all say that in public, okay.\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nYes, that is why I said it.\\nJim Wicklund\\nMy second question, Bernard, the transformations that you describe sound very impressive - a quantum change, you are a very different company. But you are the CEO. What changed in your outlook, your management focus? What caused you to make and start this transformation over the last two to three years after many years of running Weatherford?\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nThat is a very difficult question to answer in public, so I am just going to answer it as honestly as I can. Normally what happens when a company grows as fast as we have grown since 1987 from nothing and is very successful, possibly too successful and then of course discovers at some point in time it is not terribly well-managed.\\nThe person that was responsible for the growth and everything else, but probably did not pay enough attention to how well it was being managed, is replaced and someone else comes in and doesn't have to answer that question. I au contraire get to answer the question which makes it a little bit difficult. So I will tell you.\\nAbove all I want Weatherford to do well. This has nothing to do with me personally. I want Weatherford to do well. I know what Weatherford has and what it doesn't have. I know the wealth at Weatherford that is there to be harvested, I know what is missing. A little bit like one would know a child.\\nWhen I realized all the trouble we went through and it was extraordinarily painful for our shareholders, for management too but for our shareholders above all, that was before oil declined, I realized what had to be done. And to the extent I am able to guide the company so that it does what needs to be done which is essentially operational and financial discipline, that is it. There is no strategic issues.\\nYou can argue we should have this, we should have that, but it doesn't matter really. What we have is enough. To the extent that I can help the company guide both operationally and financial discipline - on the financial discipline I rely immensely on my close colleague Krishna. And then I think it is quite straightforward the progress that we will deliver.\\nNow oil tends to both mask all of this and its impact facilitate all of this. It helps also, we can go much further much faster. It also masks to a degree the level of progress because it's such a horrific environment. But our shareholders or the financial markets should know that when it comes to us, we're not just fighting hard to adapt to a lower level of activity, we're transforming the company. And it is first and foremost an operational issue and the financial underpinnings are there to accelerate it and also measure it and keep it disciplined. But it is above all an operational issue. And it is - we're way advanced in it, far more than we would have hoped.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\\nJames West\\nBernard, I want to go back to the international markets where you talked about increasing market share as we go through 2016. And even with the market probably being down the 20% that Bill mentioned and we certainly agree with that, you would only be down about half of that. Is this market share gains that you've already achieved or contracts that are won? Or is this - and are in the bag? Or do need to win more contracts to achieve that type of result?\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nIt is not in the bag, James, insofar as I wouldn't take any contracts that we bagged as being reliable. The point being that in a time of extreme strain it would be dishonest for me to tell you how well we booked it. The fact is that when we look at what we have it is essentially committed to, but I am taking a discount simply because I know that in this world and at this time clients can adjourn, they can postpone. And what is the oilfield service player going to do about it? Nothing, just wait.\\nSo the answer is there is some risk that we don't - that the assessment that we can hold back, if you will, the volume declines to about half what the market will be. There is some risk that we're not successful. I will point out to you that the place where we will play the hardest which is Eastern Hemisphere, so far - and we haven't really gotten our stride yet, we kept our own. In fact we have done more than keeping our own.\\nSo I will summarize by saying we have the business. It is not in my judgment reliable because it is not reliable for anybody in this environment. But we do have the business already. Let's assume we lose some, we will be have to paddle our canoe harder to gain some more; I think we can. Of all of the calibration we gave 2016, they are all sort of midpoint between conservative and more aggressive, this one is also the same. We actually have a more conservative view, but also a more aggressive view. This is really the reasonable midpoint.\\nJames West\\nOkay, got it. And then if we switch over to North America where the decline has been and is probably going to be a lot worse, at least based on initial CapEx guidance from your customer base. You have the positives of the artificial - strength in artificial lifts but you have a little more exposure to Canada. How do you think you fare in the North American market versus your peer group?\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nI think our - look, to the extent we're backing off, remember 20% of what we do is identified into our two product lines that we personally will only play if we can make a living which is pressure pumping and drilling tools.\\nTo the extent we deemphasize this, I would say that perhaps on the revenue side we won't fare so well because we may step back from these businesses - not entirely, but as the case may be more than anybody else. At this time I would say on the profitability standpoint we may actually fare better.\\nSo my suggestion is that as the Q1/Q2 sort of roll out going into Q3 which, as I mentioned, we - our [indiscernible] objective is to bring it into a breakeven quarter, we may very well in North America show - continue to show great resilience at the profitability level, but not so great revenue performance simply because deemphasizing [indiscernible] - as the other product lines do more than hold their own.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is open.\\nAngie Sedita\\nSo on the CapEx side and certainly I understand you are sitting on quite a bit of inventory. But as you slash CapEx in 2016 and 2015, are there business lines or regions that continue to be obviously your top priority? And then certain business lines or regions that you are a lower priority obviously in this type of market? And are there product lines or regions that you could exit and may be unlikely to return to in the coming near term years?\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nI will say a few words and then, Krishna, you might want to come and also on this. This is a very good question, Angie; it is a bit difficult to answer it on a call. But we have - we have and we're going through a meticulous process. We're not doing it ourselves, it has been done by the field and the product line leadership. We're going through every single segment in which we play around the world.\\nAnd you can imagine that with 12 different product service lines as we're organized and with the worldwide infrastructure we have there is lots and lots of questions to be asked. And we ask ourselves, could we do more? Should we stay? Should we do less? Should we pull in simple terms? We're doing this. And what are our metrics, financial metrics and also strategic as incline and reservoir metrics. They balance one another.\\nSo, yes, we will pull out of certain country and regions on certain product lines and so forth. At the same time we will push much harder on others, not only for now because they - as little business as there is we can do better than we have. But also because of the potential longer term.\\nThere isn't an overriding theme though, Angie, as in we're pulling out of this, pulling out of that, no. I would say in general that overall it is fair to say that Eastern Hemisphere - overall there are differences in Eastern Hemisphere - we'll tend to fare better. I am not saying this - fare well but better than any other parts of what we have, although there are pockets that I see in America which will fare well.\\nIn North America we will become and have become a fortress of efficiency. So net-net we will pull out of certain involvement in certain countries, certain product lines, but there is an overriding theme. The core is the core. We like the core. We try to make it as profitable as we can for now and for long term, but the core hasn't changed.\\nAngie Sedita\\nSo the cost side, obviously transformation, as you have said for some period of time here, has been necessary. But when you think through your headcount as well as your non-labor portion of your cost base, how much of that do you see is structural and necessary and permanent and how much is cyclical which could return in 2017, 2018 and beyond?\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nKrishna will answer that.\\nKrishna Shivram\\nSo, Angie, we estimate that about one-third of the cost reductions right across 2014 and 2015 are structurally permanent. Because they have to do with de-layering the organization and working on the support structure with a lot of focus. So if you add the two years together, we had $1.4 billion of annualized savings in 2015, another $600,000 in 2014 which we did not talk about on the call. One-third of that is I would say permanent.\\nAnd when the recovery does happen we just have to constrain two things, we have to constrain the support cost, of course and keep the permanent reductions permanent, of course. And the second part is to constrain CapEx. And we believe our incrementals, both in earnings and in cash flow, free cash flow will be enormous [Technical Difficulty]. We're not even talking pricing here, we're just talking--\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nYes, it seems a bit academic for us to focus on the upside in a recovery. And we don't speculate, notwithstanding my comments on oil which probably were not terribly, terribly new. We don't speculate at all at any time in the market. We operate the company as if we're in a dismal environment for the very long term.\\nWe still also think though that is not going to be the case about structurally changing the economics of the company at a high level of operations. Clearly a strong recovery, if that was to happen, we would not be able to hold the indirects flat where they are today forever, but there would be a period of time and level of volume increase where we can and hence the strength of the incrementals.\\nThis 1/3rd of $2 billion is not just a Wall Street story. We've long given up on Wall Street stories. This is actually real. So $600 million to $700 million in our cost structure at Weatherford today are perennial. That means $0.60 to $0.70 per share, if you want to look at it that way, in a normalized manner in our cost structure have gone away in an up market, that is all.\\nAngie Sedita\\nAnd then one final quick one, you said that you gained some share on the artificial lift side in the international market. Is there a bigger push in this environment in the Eastern Hemisphere with artificial lift? And is there more to be gained on the market share in 2016? It looks like that is helping your margin there?\\nBernard Duroc-Danner\\nI think actually, Angie, I would love to say yes. The reality is that lift, yes, but not any more than any completion probably is just as much and probably more - share gains. I think things that we very seldom talk about like liner hangers for example or cementation have share gains that are possible. Managed pressure drilling share gains are in an expansion of a type of technology which is not used very much. And I think in general formation evaluation has.\\nAnd it sounds like it's almost everything, but it really depends where. But if I was going to say which one has the - of all of them has probably the strongest share gains in percentage and all that sort of stuff today, I would say completion probably more so than lift. Lift is fine, but one is actually likely to grow at a higher rate than the other.\\nKaren David-Green\\nThank you, Angie and thank you all for joining us today. We have approached the hour, so this does conclude our conference call. You may now disconnect.\",\n",

       "  \"Operator\\nGood morning. My name is Laurie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weatherford International first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, today's call is being recorded. Thank you.\\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Karen David-Green, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Marketing and Communications. Please go ahead.\\nKaren David-Green - Vice President – Investor Relations, Corporate Marketing & Communication\\nThank you, Laurie. Good morning, and welcome to the Weatherford International first quarter conference call. With me on today's call from Geneva we have Bernard Duroc-Danner, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Krishna Shivram, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Weatherford's website for 10 days.\\nBefore we begin with our opening comments, I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our first quarter press release, which can be found on our website, for the customary caution on forward-looking statements and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.\\nAnd now I'd like to hand over the call to Krishna.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a brief recap of our operating performance in the first quarter.\\nOverall, this was a disappointing quarter reflecting a sudden plunge in revenue across all regions, led by North American, while our aggressive cost reduction actions were not enough to stem the revenue drop, resulting in a sharp decline in operating margins. Loss per share for the quarter, before charges and credits, was $0.29. Revenue of $1.6 billion for the quarter decreased 21% sequentially and 43% year on year. The sequential decline was affected by a sharp decrease in the level of product sales as customers around the world cut back on product spending, which is partly seasonal after a strong Q4 and partly reflective of the new lower 2016 spending budget kicking in for these customers.\\nProduct sales were down 30% sequentially, mainly in the U.S., Canada, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Latin American markets, with the Artificial Lift and Completion product lines declining the most. Excluding the decrease in product sales, service revenue was down 16% sequentially, in line with our peers. Operating income margins, before R&D and corporate expenses, declined by 943 basis points sequentially to negative 6.6%. Excluding the rigs business, our core business revenue decreased 21% sequentially with a 931 basis point deterioration in operating income margins to negative 5.4%.\\nRight though this long down cycle, we've been cutting costs and reducing our structure to cope with reduced activity and pricing pressures. This was evidenced by our 2015 decrementals versus 2014, which were best in class at 28%. While we continued to reduce costs in 2016, we have now reached the point in several operating locations around the world where any further reductions in structure or in cost will mean exiting the business in those locations. This means that we have reached a point where we will incur short-term operating losses by continuing operations at these locations. We have chosen to maintain this minimum cost structure, as the difficulty and the cost of rebooting and rebuilding our businesses when activity levels eventually increase far outweigh the short-term benefit of eliminating these businesses altogether. In all, we are carrying about $48 million in such costs, representing 300 basis points of margin and about $0.05 in earnings per share terms in our Q1 results.\\nBelow operating margins, R&D costs reduced by $7 million, while corporate costs were down $4 million, reflecting spending cuts in line with the reduced budgets for this year. The tax benefit recorded in the first quarter reflected the tax benefit on the losses in the U.S. primarily, which are recoverable, partly offset by tax provisions internationally. The tax rate for 2016 will be dependent on the geographical mix of earnings and will be heavily weighted by results in the United States.\\nExcluding the rigs business, sequential decrementals were 38% on a 21% revenue drop, and year-over-year decrementals were reasonable at 27% on a 44% revenue decrease. Adjusting operating income for R&D and corporate expenses, our sequential decrementals improved to 35%, while the year-over-year decrementals improved to 24%. We expect to hold sequential decrementals in the low 30s going forward, while the year-over-year decrementals should hold in the mid-20s. Bernard will comment in more detail on the operating results and the outlook later in the call.\\nComing to net debt and cash flow now, net debt reduced by $373 million to reach $6.6 billion at March 31. This reflects mainly the net proceeds from the equity offering of $630 million, partly offset by consumption of $216 million in operations this quarter. The negative free cash flow performance, while disappointing, was significantly better than the $266 million free cash flow consumption of Q1 in 2015, despite recording much steeper losses this year. All our larger peers recorded negative free cash flow in the first quarter this year. However, we were the only ones to improve versus Q1 of last year on the free cash flow metric. Excluding the cash flow consumption of $47 million on the Zubair contract in Iraq, $71 million of severance and restructuring cash costs, and $50 million of out-of-period interest payments, free cash flow was a negative $48 million for the quarter.\\nWorking capital balances reduced by $119 million, reflecting strong customer collections and inventory reductions. CapEx was well-controlled and was low at $43 million. As of March 31, available liquidity was $1.4 billion. The debt-to-cap calculation came in at 53.6%, versus the 70% covenant, meaning there was significant headroom against the covenant.\\nI would now like to update our free cash flow forecast of the year. Primarily due to the large unexpected losses in Q1 and the continuing trough into Q2, we now revise our full-year free cash flow forecast to be between $400 million and $500 million. This downward revision by $200 million versus our previous forecast takes into account three parameters: lower earnings by $350 million, partly offset by lower working capital, principally receivables, by $100 million, and lower CapEx by $50 million.\\nLosses for the year will be higher, reflecting the unexpected sharp drop in activity and pricing levels in Q1, which is expected to persist into Q2. With lower revenue, receivables will generate additional liquidity of $100 million. And given the low spend in Q1, a $250 million CapEx revised target for the year should not be difficult to achieve, particularly with the low start to the year.\\nConsistent with the previous forecast, this new forecast assumes that we will strike an out-of-court settlement agreement on change orders with our customer on the Zubair EPF contract in Iraq. If we are not successful in reaching a satisfactory settlement, we will take the matter to an international arbitration panel. And while the cash settlement in this scenario could well be delayed into 2017, we believe the settlement through an arbitration process would be for a significantly larger amount. Such a turn of events could reduce this year's free cash flow forecast by an additional $150 million to $200 million. Discussions with our client are ongoing. The progress on the Zubair project has been very good, with only three final milestones remaining out of 18 to be achieved. We expect these milestones to be achieved by the end of May.\\nWe successfully repaid the bond of $350 million that matured in February 2016, as well as certain other short-term facilities totaling $150 million. With this revised free cash flow forecast, we expect net debt levels to reduce to below $6 billion by the end of the year.\\nMoving on to the new credit facility now. Given the environment we are in and the extreme pressure banks are facing with their exposure to the energy, principally E&P, industry, with significant loan loss provisions being recorded by almost every bank, this was not the ideal time to negotiate a revolver for a non-investment grade name like ours. However, as our current revolver was due to expire in July 2017, we had no choice but to renegotiate this facility before it went current. After over two months of difficult discussions and an extremely thorough examination by our banks, I am pleased to announce that we have successfully negotiated new financing agreements, which will be effective from next week, and replace the current facility.\\nHere are the key features of this new financing facility. Firstly, it includes a secure term loan of $500 million. This term loan matures in July 2020. Next, it includes an unsecured revolver of $1.151 billion, expiring in July 2019. Both of these new facilities are enhanced by appropriate upstream subsidiary guarantees. A residual revolver totaling $229 million, expiring in July next year, covering banks that declined to extend the current facility, is also available.\\nOf the 17 banks in our previous facility, 15 of them agreed to extend their cover, with only four of the 15 reducing their commitment slightly. Two banks declined to participate in the extension, but their current commitments will stay in place until July 2017. This demonstrates the strong relationship we have with the majority of our banking group who share our common view of the future. The term loan will amortize down 10% annually, while the revolver will amortize down by 5% in the first year and then by 10% annually after that, but will not reduce below $1 billion.\\nWe will have the following covenants to adhere to during the life of the facilities. Firstly, a specified debt-to-EBITDA ratio of below 3.0 times until the end of 2016, and then below 2.5 times after that. As of March 31, on a backtest, we are at 1.1 times versus the 3.0 times, meaning there's plenty of headroom. For covenant purposes, specified debt is defined as the debt enhanced by subsidiary guarantees and represents only the drawn amounts against the facilities, while the EBITDA is defined to exclude all non-cash charges, such as impairments and write-offs of assets.\\nSecondly, we have a covenant which is defined as follows: a specified debt plus letters of credit – that means the sum total of the two – to EBITDA ratio of below 4.0 times until the end of 2016, and then below 3.5 times after that. The only difference from the previous covenant is the addition of outstanding letters of credit or guarantees to the level of specified debt, and a higher ratio by one turn to accommodate these LCs. As of March 31, on a backtest, we are at 1.7 times versus the requirement of 4 times, meaning, again, there's plenty of headroom.\\nThere's also a third covenant, which is specified assets to specified debt – we must maintain a ratio of at least 4 times. As of March 31, this ratio is at 14 times, meaning, again, there's substantial headroom on the third covenant. Based on our forecast over the life of the facility, we expect to retain and in fact improve the headroom versus these three covenants.\\nAs we negotiated these covenants at a time when the industry is at a trough, we were able to secure extremely accommodating covenants which have almost no danger of breach during the life of the facilities. We also ran a stressed model, assuming a flat $40 oil price until the end of 2018. This model results in flat revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow in 2017 and 2018 at 2016 levels or slightly lower. Even under such a draconian set of assumptions, we retain significant headroom versus these three negotiated covenants.\\nFinally, the debt-to-cap covenant that existed up until now has been discarded and is not valid anymore. Just to be clear, we will have a $1.88 billion facility starting next week, down from $2 billion. This facility will reduce to $1.54 billion after amortization in July 2017; then it'll reduce down to $1.4 billion as of July 2018, and so on. Such a reduction should not be viewed as constraining to Weatherford. As a matter of fact, the total actual drawdown against the facilities for the last several quarters have been as follows: $1.04 billion as of 30th September last year; $967 million as of last year-end, and now $1.04 billion as of the end of the first quarter this year, which are far below any of these levels that I mentioned. At its lowest point of availability, which is $1.4 billion as of July 2018, we still have sufficient headroom when recent utilization levels of approximately $1 billion are taken into account.\\nAs a reminder, we also maintain roughly $500 million of cash balances on an ongoing basis. So, when you net that off against the outstanding revolver, you've got to reduce $500 million of cash is roughly fungible. I would like to also remind you that off a total gross debt of $7.1 billion at March 31, only the revolver drawdown of $1.04 billion has any financial covenants attached to it. The remaining debt, comprising mainly long-term bonds, which is over 80% of our total debt, do not carry any ratio-driven covenants, nor do they carry any credit rating triggers.\\nI would like to conclude my prepared remarks by addressing our plan to manage the upcoming bond maturities over the next several years. The total value of bond maturities from 2017 through to 2020 is $2.9 billion. Here is how we plan to finance the repayment of these bonds.\\nFirstly, free cash flow is expected to be in the $400 million to $500 million range this year, as I explained previously. Add to that a range of $600 million to $750 million annually of free cash flow for each of the next four years, and you get a total of $2.4 billion to $3 billion. These cash flows assume a recovering and strengthening oilfield services market resulting in improved margins – improving margins but solid incrementals, given the reduction on a fixed cost base. And despite investment in working capital to fuel the growth, CapEx will continue to be muted as our excess capacity gets fully utilized, delaying significant growth CapEx spending into 2019.\\nNext, we expect to divest the land rigs business over the next three years, when industry conditions and valuations get better. Our current estimate is that the cash component of such a transaction would be between $500 million and $1 billion.\\nLastly, we will opportunistically tap the public debt markets to refinance some of these bond maturities, and over the next four years, we believe debt markets will be open to us. In reality, we believe there is a high-yield market open to us even today.\\nIn conclusion, a combination of free cash flow, proceeds from asset sales, and potential new debt issuances will allow us to comfortably manage the upcoming debt maturities. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bernard.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Krishna. And good morning, everyone. Few comments on Q1 results.\\nHistorically, Q1 is always our worst quarter. This year's the same. The four key numbers are revenue declined 21% sequentially, 43% year on year; decrementals of 38% sequentially and 28% year on year; free cash flow was $216 million use of cash, $50 million better than Q1 2015, and that without any consideration for large severance cash payments and final cash outlay for the Zubair. Free cash flow doesn't matter for our peers as it does for us, given balance sheet differentials. It is worth observing Weatherford's free cash flow numbers as is, inclusive of all, we're the best – or the least bad, if you will – in class year-on-year performers of our peer group. This isn't an accident: The company has, at all levels of operations, an ingrained focus on cash flow here and now and perennially.\\nBreaking down Q1 revenues into its main components, product sales dropped by over 30%, service revenues by 16%, and rigs by 19%. This added up to a sequential 21% drop. Product sales usually drop sequentially in Q1, and this year was no exception. The overwhelming majority of the drop was seasonal and particularly affected the Eastern Hemisphere. Product sales for Weatherford are Well Construction, except TRS and Managed Pressure Drilling, Completion, and Lift. Service revenues are Tubular Running Services, MPD, and Formation Evaluation. Taken together, the proportion of product sales to the total revenues is on average about 40%, with large quarter-to-quarter variations. Product sales will improve in Q2 seasonally.\\nRegionally, the quarter was difficult in every corner of the world. Both the U.S. and Canada were very challenged. Canada's Q1 was the lowest in company's recorded history for first quarter, normally that region's strongest seasonal peak. Q1 was in fact lower than Q2 of last year, during a then already very depressed breakup. It's quite unimaginable, the activity crash. The U.S. was just as bad, but no worse than Canada, thanks to tremendous effort around sales, operational execution, and extreme cost management. Much of our market performance was exemplary, except for two service lines, which have consistently handicapped our U.S. operations: pressure pumping and rentals. No surprise there. With 30% of U.S. revenues in Q1 being counted for 76% of the losses, those numbers say it all.\\nRevenues for NAM declined by 22%, and decrementals were a more severe 39%. Year-on-year decrementals were held at 19%, a 53% revenue decline, which was excellent cost management in the midst of a collapsing volume and pricing environment. For the first time in 15 months, we held back on further organizational cost action in NAM beyond what was planned. By March, with only a few exceptions, we decided not to curtail employee counts or basin presence any further. We decided to keep some measure of staffing in place in U.S. and Canada on furlough, waiting on market direction beyond Q2.\\nLatin America held better than NAM, albeit it was also very strained. Revenues declined by 18% sequentially, decrementals were held at 18% also at a very decent 30% year on year by aggressive cost control. All country operations declined except Argentina. Colombia, traditionally one of our largest Latin American operations, was eviscerated. Brazil and Mexico weakened further. We had already seriously curtailed Venezuela last year, so the operational minimum necessary fell onto our nucleus organization and infrastructure.\\nEastern Hemisphere experienced a severe seasonal in addition to cyclical downturn in activity. As highlighted earlier, our product sales were very low in the quarter, representing much of the company's overall product sales drop. That drove 22% lower revenues and 45% decrementals sequentially – high for us because product sales typically carry higher margins. Cost reductions could not help as much as they will; they lagged North America for local regulatory reasons by about two quarters.\\nIn the European, Caspian, Russian, SSA region, revenue was down 24%, reflecting sharp seasonal winter declines in Russia and North Sea, coupled with project cancellations across SSA. SSA margin has dipped ever so slightly into negative territory, as costs could not make up for activity reduction fast enough.\\nRevenues in Middle East and Asia Pacific region decreased by 20%, with margins dropping to just under 2%, with sharp seasonal declines across several parts of the Asia Pacific region. MENA showed resilience, but much was offset by a combination of very low part sales in the quarter and the full effect of pricing concessions.\\nLastly, the rig operations, as expected, had a difficult quarter. It was a transitional quarter; as we moved rigs into new markets, we mobilized on new contracts. On the cost side, we announced earlier this year an additional reduction in force of 6,000. As of the end of April, almost 6,000, or 5,874 employees, had already left the payroll, substantially completing the program. We extended the program to cover another 2,000 reduction in force, bringing it to 8,000, if you will, which we expect to complete by the end of Q2. Annualized savings already crystallized from actions to date are specifically $408 million, with savings impacting Q1 to the tune of $34 million. So the bulk of it is coming in Q2, et cetera. The next two quarters will show much higher levels of savings from the actions to date.\\nSimilarly, the cash cost of the severance program was heavy in Q1, heavier than we expected. There will be lower severance cash payouts in Q2 as a corollary. We had also announced the closure of nine manufacturing facilities this year. Of this, four were shut in Q1 alone. In addition, 26 operating and service facilities were shut down in North America during the quarter. All this added to a difficult but productive quarter, which was expected, and also we believe will set the trough for the year in this cyclical depression, which brings me to the outlook for Q2.\\nNAM results will be weaker in Q2. Revenues will decline Q1 on Q2, similarly to Q4 and Q1. The depth and breadth of cost cuts achieved will improve the decrementals versus Q1, but the region's operating income will decline further. We believe Q2, though, will be the trough for Weatherford's NAM. Latin America will also be weaker in Q2, but substantially less than now in terms of decline. Q2 will look similar to Q1 and will likely have single-digit lower revenues and operating income, no worse. We also believe Q2 will be the trough for Weatherford Latin America.\\nEastern Hemisphere in Q2 will be up modestly Q1 on Q2, revenues and, more significantly, operating income. The increase in revenues is one factor; the different mix with a return of product sales is the other factor, probably a larger factor, together with a much lower cost basis. The cost cuts have a lag, remember, and they will benefit Eastern Hemisphere starting from Q2. This brings us to the following assessment: We believe Q1 will have been the trough for Weatherford's Eastern Hemisphere.\\nLastly, the rig operation will improve gradually its profitability in Q2, and there on. Because of the mobilization, Q1 will have been the trough also for our rig operation. Now, I do realize our assessment of both Latin America and even more so Eastern Hemisphere for Q2 is at a variance to our larger peers. Remember, although we overlap and compete in Formation Evaluation and Completion, by and large we do not in what we call Well Construction and Lift. In Well Construction and Lift, we are more complementary than competitive and have, at times, a somewhat different prognosis timewise for performance. Adding the pieces together, our view is that Q2 will net out at a similar net income to Q1 with a worse NAM but a better international.\\nBy the end of Q2, we'll have concluded the bulk of our two-year massive cost restructuring, leaving behind only supply chain work underway. The change in efficiency and cost structure make a very large and structural difference. We also believe there will be seasonal and some early signs, however modest, of cyclical market improvements in Q3 and Q4. Profitability in the second half 2016 will be improved over the first half.\\nWe're preparing cautiously, but with determination, for the beginnings of a possible recovery. The decision to opt for a furlough program in North America, rather than more organizational shrinkage, is a clear example of such. The turn will come and will come early for us. Weatherford is more development than production and exploration. We are more land than offshore. We're best-positioned to benefit from the first turn in the market. Two examples, In NAM, our Completion and Lift portfolios are directly applicable to the gradual completions of the drilled but uncompleted wells. Second, the massive destocking of client inventories for rod lift and PCP lift equipment will be the first drivers of a turn. That's for NAM.\\nInternationally, Russia and pockets of Latin America will be the first movers, while our Middle East region will accelerate its rebuilding through the second half of the year. Again, we remain very cautious, but we are building our own conviction that second half 2016 will be better for Weatherford and the beginning of a long-term turn.\\nReiteration of 2016 priorities. At the time of this call, we have successfully achieved banking commitments for our credit line through July 2019 to replace existing lines. Successful equity offering of last March also provided additional liquidity. Both capital formation events are clear positives and place us on safe ground. They do not change our free cash flow objectives. Free cash flow generation has ingrained the company's long-term direction. We have total organizational buy-in, specific incentives, and disciplined metrics on free cash flow objectives. With the end of the RIF or the reduction in force severance, and the Zubair financing, our free cash flow performance the balance of the year will be strong and reliable. We'll build on our operating progress today with more efficiency, cash discipline, and systematic talent upgrades and selective market share focus. We'll delever the balance sheet through free cash flow each and every year and eventually with more asset sales when achievable. This is our direction.\\nOur cost of organizational actions to date centered around improving five things and doing so in a perennial way. One, lower cost structure through cycles. Out of an estimated annualized to date $2.5 billion of cost reductions realized since 2014, we know specifically that over $1 billion are permanent or structural. This means Weatherford will have close to $1.00 a share of incremental earnings and cash flow above our prior earnings peak.\\nTwo, capital allocation and cash generation is a company-wide discipline. This is ingrained in our culture.\\nThree, leapfrog talent bench and talent development as a culture. We have upgraded our talent systematically from field to senior management. We've made talent development into an organizational priority. We never had operationally and financially as talented and deep of a bench as we have today. We may be smaller; we are much better managed.\\nFour, focus on quality and reliability for all product lines. Quality and reliability and execution everywhere, all the time, are a strategic priority. I specifically commented on these internal objectives and priority in my recent comments at the opening ceremony of the ATSE conference in Dehradun. Quality and reliability is our most important metric of operational achievement.\\nFive, technological innovation, both incremental and step change channels, strictly on our core. So buttressing our leadership where we lead and gaining leadership where we don't. During OTC which is happening now, we have hosted a three-day technology exhibition at one of our R&D centers in Houston. We had more client attendance by far than we ever experienced. We cannot afford to be technological leaders or co-leaders on all product and service lines. We can and will on our core.\\nAs the massive cost containments come to an end, I will summarize the cost accomplishments from the first days of 2015. We believe we did more and further than anyone else. Reduction in force, for a total employee count on January 1, 2015, of 55,318. We ended Q1 2016 at 34,808. We expect a trough of total head count at about 32,000 shortly after Q2, will have been (33:26) a 42% total company payroll reduction in 18 months. This is a clean cost restructuring without any divestment to assist the numbers.\\nWe took down our support ratio – which is indirects to directs or support to directs, if you will – from 59% in 2014 to where it presently stands at 38.6%. A 20% (sic) [20 percentage point] (33:49) decline in support ratio is a colossal structural change in record time. To do this in a cyclical downturn is very difficult. [ph] It is also (33:59) structural change will provide us with outsized incremental margins through the recovery years.\\nOperations were streamlined with consolidation of our geographic segments, flattening of the reporting organization, scaling down regional headquarters, and push the country closer to the sand face. (34:12) Supply chain is the midst of a two-year restructuring and productivity leapfrog. Manufacturing, logistics, and procurement are implementing fundamental productivity and efficiency change. This is an economic breakthrough for our operating cost structure flexibility of adjustment to changes in business volumes. Of all the ongoing cost initiatives, this one alone will carry forward through 2017.\\nMuch of the above describes what we accomplished taking advantage of extremely depressed market conditions. The operating decisions will now be adjusted. We're calling for an end to our reduction in force drive and organizational compression. The last remnants of the layoffs will occur in Q2, but beyond, we'll arrest the direct cost drive and prepare cautiously, but prepare nonetheless, for a turn in our markets. Only the vast supply chain reorganization work will continue until full completion. Weatherford is well advanced in its fundamental transformation. From cost structure, cooperating practices, and quality focus, returns objective, and a culture of sales, we are a completely different company in the making. Our performance in the recovery to come will surprise to the upside.\\nI have a few comments on macro, but I'll keep them to a minimum. We have long said that after a lag, decline rates would accelerate, that the effects were underestimated and the industry was producing at near capacity, which is something none of us have ever experienced. We'll also add in that the industry will not be able to manage required oil demand as early as 2017. This means oil demand would not be met by existing oil capacity. Inventory overhang will help, but by definition it isn't more than a stopgap solution. We more than ever believe all the above is correct. Other than a few barrels coming from Iran, in theory one day from Libya, by our assessment the industry has little spare capacity beyond the present operating rates. Project announcements to the contrary, we believe this to be accurate.\\nFurthermore, elasticity of supply response to higher oil prices are being ignored or overstated. In my 30 years in the oilfield and my prior years watching my father operate in same, I have never seen anything like it. The full return cost of developing existing bases around the world, including the U.S. tight oil reservoirs, will not work financially unless oil pricing and related financing change and change fast to a materially different level. This is how we see our industry situation.\\nIn summary, regardless of the macro outcome, we're making Weatherford focused, operationally very strong, disciplined, and returns-driven. We'll never go down the same path to excessive leverage ever again. We have fundamentally changed our cost structure, quality, efficiency, returns culture, and emphatically our talent bench. This is today a very different company. We'll maintain strong free cash flow and liquidity. We dedicate our every effort to delever the balance sheet and do so permanently. We are positioning Weatherford with selected markets and clients, using our product line strengths and specific technological leadership. In this time of great transactional turbulence in our industry, we have remained an island of calm and internal efficiency focus. Our operating and management capabilities are immeasurably stronger than they historically were.\\nLastly, we have a worldwide infrastructure of service support, second to none. Except for a few marginal locations internationally, we have kept the international infrastructure intact. We are confident of our technological strength, product line breadth, and market potential for organic growth. Our numbers will prove out the merits of our direction in this brutal down cycle and even more so when the market turns. We believe this is what will deliver the highest shareholder returns at the lowest risk.\\nWith that, I'll return the call to the operator for Q&A.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nYour first question is from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is open.\\nWilliam Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\\nThank you. Good morning.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nGood morning, Bill.\\nWilliam Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\\nKrishna, could we discuss Zubair a bit here, because it seems like the range of outcomes there are reasonably wide in terms of order of magnitude on impact on free cash flow possibilities for 2016. So can you discuss that with a little bit more detail? Because you talked about revising the free cash flow forecast down to $400 million, but in the event that Zubair doesn't swing your way, that could be too high by a couple hundred million dollars, if I understood you correctly. So can you shed some light on that, please?\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nYes, Bill. First of all, I said that the free cash flow forecast for the year is going to be revised down by $200 million -\\nWilliam Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\\nRight.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\n– down to about $450 million, right?\\nWilliam Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\\nRight.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nNow, included in that $450 million is an assumption that we will successfully negotiate a settlement of our variation order claims on our customer. That settlement is being discussed right now, and we have not reached a point where we can mutually agree to the settlement. If we don't reach a settlement, we will not get any more cash, even against the milestone payments that are due to us contractually, because we believe our customer will withhold all cash going forward. If that happens, then about $150 million to $200 million of cash that could otherwise have come to us, including the settlement estimate, will not come to us anymore. So which means basically the $450 million of free cash flow will then reduce by $150 million, $200 million, right? That's what I was talking about. Now, in fact, we're getting closer to a settlement agreement with our customer, and if we maybe, if everything works out, be able to announce a settlement in the next several weeks. If that happens then the $450 million remains intact.\\nWilliam Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\\nSo you believe it is likely you will reach a favorable settlement on this front?\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nI think both sides are not too far apart right now, and so I think it is – I would give it more than 50% chance that we will reach a settlement, yes...\\nWilliam Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\\nAnd so what exactly – yeah, what exactly is being disputed here?\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nIt's a level of compensation for the change orders. We have a number of change orders that we have documented over the last three years, which are changes to the original design of the facility that was in the tender, and none of those change orders have been compensated for. So we have a certain claim, and that claim has not been honored or recognized by our customer. So that's basically the subject matter of the discussion.\\nWilliam Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\\nOkay. Switching gears for a second from the balance sheet. Bernard, in the event that international revenues as a whole continue to bleed lower over the course of the year, what then is the likely roadmap for margins, given the interplay between pricing concessions on the one hand and those continuing to roll through and on the other hand the more aggressive cost-cutting that you continue to implement?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, just to put things in perspective, as I mentioned, a lot of the cost cuts have not impacted much yet, but they will following Q2, the international operations. And more specifically, the Eastern Hemisphere, which takes the longest from a regulatory standpoint to be able to absorb the layoffs and so forth.\\nWe have approximately – going through all the cost cuts through Q1 – we have approximately $100 million a quarter more of cost cuts that are going to come through the Eastern Hemisphere and also Latin America. But that is actually – but a lot of it is going to come through the Eastern Hemisphere. That is quite a cushion on further erosion coming from volumes and pricing.\\nThe second thing also, Bill, is that when we talk about product sales, that is one we have some visibility on. We have a notion of what is going to be delivered or expected to be delivered in a number of different products, and that gives us also a sense of volume and margins to come. The services more, I think – I think are vulnerable in the event the project gets further canceled and so forth. Respect to pricing, we also have in a sense what was given. In our particular case, pricing concessions have been given. There is no significant amounts of other pricing concessions being negotiated for us. I'll also point out to you that there are very large tender activities which are ongoing which have been very recent, which suggests that many of our clients all the sudden are very interested in locking in volumes at current pricing, which suggests also that volume is unlikely to go down further, more likely to inch up some.\\nAll this would tell you that the cost reductions are sizable, the product line deliveries are relatively predictable, pricing concessions we have already, quite a bit, have gone through Q4 and Q1 here now. There isn't much that we know of analytically to go through incrementally in Q2. All of this to say that the road map for international in Q2, Q3, Q4, should be, depending on your viewpoint on the macro, either constructive or better than constructive in our particular case.\\nWilliam Herbert - Simmons & Co. International\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Bill.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\nOle H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\\nThanks a lot, and thanks for a SRO rundown here or how you see the world. So just to clarify, you say that a similar quarter in the second quarter to what you delivered in the first quarter – do you mean at the EPS level or at the normalized level, the EBITDA level?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. Well, actually, the EBITDA and the EPS level. The EBITDA may be a little bit higher, but not materially. But net-net at the net income level, the EPS level, similar, made up of deteriorating North America further, if it was possible. Latin America a little bit lower, and Eastern Hemisphere a little bit higher on the top line, but operating income the biggest moving part for us. Simply because of product mix in Q2 versus Q1. You add the pieces together, it suggests to us that we would have Q1 or Q2 flat at the earnings level. Albeit, the revenues may come down some when all these are added up together.\\nOle H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\\nAnd if I think about the normalized free cash flow loss in the first quarter as $50 million, and if it excludes Zubair on the second quarter, what would a reasonable range be to bracket the second quarter free cash flow, excluding Zubair?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Let's put Zubair on the side because it is a one-time event. And so, for clarity's sake, without Zubair, our free cash flow in Q2 should be $100 million to $125 million – something like that – excluding Zubair. That's net of whatever severance would be still occurring, which would be less than in Q1, but some still.\\nOle H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\\nUnderstood. And just finally, at your macro statement you highlighted the declines. Is it anything particularly that you see around the world which makes you more confident that we are closer to this inflection point in any particular region, or anything else that you see?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nI would say that one of the benefits of having a fabulous team around me at Weatherford today is I tend to have more time to do what I think might be useful at this juncture. And what is more useful I think at this juncture is try to interact as much as I can with the client base. And that's a long-term process.\\nWhat does that have to do with your question? I have, then, a multiplicity of verbal, qualitative, but meaningful nonetheless, data points from the Continental Europe, from Russia, from Latin America, from pockets of the Middle East. And I know full well what's going on in the deepwater plays, which are longer to have an effect – so ignoring the latter, just all the commentary on the particular regions I'm describing, I add them together – it doesn't take a great modeling capability to see a frightening amount of volume being lost permanently. And it doesn't have to be spectacular individually – 100,000, 150,000 being lost over a period of a few quarters and accelerating, but you add them all together and the picture is – for us actually is, as much as we recompute our numbers all the time, because we have a hard time believing it, the picture is one of a shrinking supply base, which we do not see any available capacity, which is there to be able to replace it. Certainly not on call, and I mean on call within a year or two. It's qualitative but it's multifaceted. Many, many client interactions, particularly in more relaxed atmosphere after meetings take place.\\nOle H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\\nWell, thanks for that, Bernard. I look forward to discussing that with you in more detail at a later stage. I'll hand it back.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nYour next question is from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nGood morning, guys.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nGood morning, Jim.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nJust as a quick follow-up to Bill's, how much – will you lose any cash in Zubair in Q2?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nSo it depends on – Jim, it depends on whether you assume we strike a settlement or not. If we do not strike -\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nOkay. If you do strike a settlement, will the cash actually hit in the second quarter? Is that what you're saying?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, so that's part of the settlement discussion. So we don't know where that's going to end up. But assuming that no settlement takes place at all, right, and we go to arbitration, then, yes, we will have a cash outflow in April and May.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nWell, I understand getting paid back for change orders; I'm just trying to figure out how much the operating loss – cash loss would be.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. They're intertwined. So operating cash loss was about $10 million to $15 million a month, and we will have two months of operations -\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nOkay, that's helpful.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\n– in the second quarter. That's the worst-case scenario.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nOkay. That's what I was looking for. Okay, thanks.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd, Jim, if that is the case, the operation would come to an end anyway at the end of this month.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nThere are several of us who are looking forward to Zubair being over almost as much as you are.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nIt's not possible. It's not possible...\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nAlmost. Almost. You'd be amazed. CapEx, you've dropped CapEx by 80%-plus since 2014. I understand there's overcapacity. Your rental business is not doing fabulous, and that's, I guess, historically been a big eater of CapEx. How much do you jeopardize the future? How much are you going to have to ramp up in 2019? I mean, are we sacrificing -?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. I'll give the beginning of an answer, and then Krishna will do the second half. If you take CapEx and you break it down into three different places of application – so you talk about the infrastructure, which is all the bases around the world, you talk about supply chain, and you talk about the tools, the service tools – generally, service tool being applicable to whether it's a completion service tool, whether it's an LWD kit, et cetera, okay? I would have to say that the supply chain as it now stands can accommodate easily, easily three times the volume we have. And that's actually almost a silly statement because we have no – we have plenty of machining and roof line and so forth. So we're rationalizing it right now. It is not a source of CapEx requirement until and unless the industry is materially different. And I'm talking a level of volume that you do not expect anytime soon, talking about years. So that one is just not a consumer CapEx.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nYeah.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThen we get into the infrastructure. We rationalize North America. We did take down a number of facilities, not too many internationally. We now have in 85 countries by my latest count, the sort of base representation we feel is desirable, given our long-term presence, et cetera. And I would have to say that the infrastructure can accommodate more than two times the volume that we are running through the company today, easily. That, again, is not an area of CapEx. I will remind you that we built this infrastructure ourselves. It was a big user of CapEx in years past.\\nThen you get to the tool side, the service tool side. Well, we do have – take a look at our inventory, take a look at our PP&E. Depending on what kind of tool, it will be in one or the other category. By our assessment also, we have largely available somewhere between – tool components that can accommodate 50% to twice the size of volume we have. Right. That's a lot of numbers that suggest we're not starving the business. We're very careful how we do it. We're not sort of holding our breath waiting for better times. We have far more PP&E and equipment capabilities than people realize, which is, in a way, sanctioning an overspending of the past, which none of can be proud of, least of all myself. But it is an assessment today. You should not presume we're starving. Do you want to add, Krishna, to that?\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nYes, I think that then when you look at 2017 and 2018, we can certainly spend very low levels of CapEx while still maintaining a healthy growth potential. And then from 2019 onwards I would suggest that as a percentage of revenue we will stay at between 5% to 6% of revenue for the next two or three years. So this is quite low compared to historical levels, but it's well-explained by Bernard. We have plenty of capacity.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nOkay. And my follow-up, if I could, Latin America, what and where gets better first?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThat's a good question. I would say that my guess – it's a guess – is Colombia primarily, because it's so devastated and it's heavily a land market, you know that. And although it's (53:44) heavily a land market, it's so eviscerated, they don't have the kind of political upheaval you have here in Brazil. Argentina has remained healthy. I can't imagine Venezuela because they are so financially, let's say strained. That leaves Mexico. But Mexico is still going through a lot of the restructuring of the industry and so forth and so on. So by process of elimination I have to say Colombia is your best bet.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nOkay. Thanks, gentlemen, appreciate it. And thanks for the detail.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Jim.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie of IBERIA Capital. Your line is open.\\nRob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC\\nThanks, guys. Bernard, a couple questions for you, if I may. First, are you guys seeing any signs of pickup, say, in the U.S. in any kind of completions or workover activity for you guys? And, secondly, as part of your conversations with your customers that you talked about earlier, how have those changed, if you will, over the past week, two weeks, month, two months? Are we seeing a turn in sentiment there?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nOkay. On the first one, I'm sorry to say, that, no, there isn't any signs of a pickup or anything else like that as of today in the U.S. – i.e., I think the U.S., it's really a question of cash flow for our clients. And that's price of oil, and it's also financing capabilities. This is one thing.\\nThe second is interesting question. It's very simple. I'm getting a lot of questions on what I am seeing in terms of production rate difficulties with other reservoirs and other plays from particular clients wanting to know how the other ones are doing, what do I see in terms of trends. It's sort of interesting that they want to compare their own difficulties on and around decline rates with other difficulties, not so much for competitive reasons, but to get a sense what is happening to the industry.\\nThere's been a real lot – these are informal conversations. They are outside of the realm of formal meetings which take place also with clients. And I think, for me, are far more valuable than the formal aspects. So it's a lot of conversations, systematically, really, from what am I seeing in other parts of the world. One of the advantages of being an oilfield service person, from an oil and gas perspective, is you get to see lots of reservoirs and lots of reservoir situations, actually more so than the people exploiting it, who are constrained or restricted to the ones they're developing. You have a rich sort of pool of information as, if you will, a traveling salesman, as it were.\\nRob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC\\nGreat. Thank you. But in terms of what they're indicating to you – I understand that they're pumping you for information, but what are they indicating to you, if anything, about how their plans are evolving?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThey are sort of – in general, they have no authority or capital or plans for additional drilling, and they're trying to hold off decline rates. And they are, in many cases, it's coming to the point where they cannot do that anymore and so it creates a lot of strain and worries, and they're quite anxious to know where and when cash flow will allow them to restart activity, because they're very afraid of losing production rather rapidly now. There is an acceleration. You hold it off and ultimately there is acceleration.\\nRob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC\\nGreat...\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nSo there's really a sense of – we're at the point now where they are afraid of declines that they cannot hold off, hence their interest in understanding where and when the industry could have a turn because they're sort of worried about their own production profile, given the fact they're running out of – through intervention and the sorts of things you can do with a limited budget, very, very scarce drilling, they're worried about being able to hold off the decline rates where they are without them accelerating further.\\nRob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC\\nThat's very helpful. Thank you.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nYou have no further questions at this time.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nThen we'll conclude the call. Thank you very much.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\",\n",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weatherford International Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up then re-enter the queue for additional questions that you may have. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, today's call is being recorded. Thank you.\\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Karen David-Green, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Marketing and Communications. You may begin your conference.\\nKaren David-Green - Vice President-Investor Relations, Corporate Marketing and Communications\\nThank you, Kim. Good morning and welcome to the Weatherford International second quarter conference call. I'd like to thank everyone for accommodating the earlier start to this conference call. As you know, we wanted to avoid an overlap of our call with one of our peers. With me on today's call, we have Bernard Duroc-Danner, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Krishna Shivram, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Weatherford's website for 10 days.\\nBefore we begin with our opening comments, I'd like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website for the customary caution on forward-looking statements and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.\\nAnd now I'd like to hand over the call to Krishna.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a recap of our operating performance in the second quarter. Overall, our revenue of $1.4 billion declined 11% or by $183 million, sequentially. While our operating income, before R&D and corporate expenses, reduced only marginally by $11 million, reflecting the beneficial impact of the large cost reduction actions taken this year. Sequential operating income margins deteriorated by 168 basis points to reach negative 8.3%. Sequential decrementals were excellent at 6%. Loss per share for the quarter, before charges and credits, was $0.28, which was $0.01 better than the first quarter, while EBITDA was flat with the first quarter at $58 million.\\nNorth America revenue declined 26%, outperforming a 35% reduction in average rig count and continued pricing headwinds. Seasonal activity reductions, due to the spring break-up in Canada, coupled with pressure pumping activity hitting new lows with two fewer crews operating at the end of the quarter, compared to the start of the quarter. Having said that, operating losses reduced substantially by $27 million with the aggressive cost actions taken this year resulting in Brazilian margins, albeit negative, of minus 25.2% and sequential incrementals of 19%.\\nInternationally, our revenue declined 3% on a sequential rig count reduction of 7%. Latin America bore the brunt of the decline with sequential revenue dropping 18%, due to steep customer spending cuts in Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia.\\nOperating income margins also fell sharply as cost reduction actions that were taken late in the quarter, while benefiting future quarters, were not enough to mitigate the drop in revenue. Operating income margins dropped to just 1%, but with the recent cost actions, this should improve going forward.\\nEastern Hemisphere revenue increased by 4% sequentially. In the Europe/Caspian/Russia/Sub-Sahara Africa region, sharp activity reductions in offshore West Africa were only partly mitigated by a seasonal recovery in Russia resulting in a sequential revenue reduction of 5% while operating margins improved to make the region profitable again.\\nIn the Middle East/North Africa/Asia Pacific region, the sequential revenue increase of 11% reflected the final contract settlement of the Zubair project and higher activity in Algeria more than offsetting declines across several Asia Pacific operations. Operating income margins declined 180 basis points to essentially a break-even level, reflecting the full impact of pricing concessions given to customers in prior quarters.\\nRevenue for the Land Rigs business declined 9%, with lower sequential utilization rates. However, strong cost reduction actions, which are structural and enduring in nature, allowed us to improve the operating income by $9 million.\\nOn the cost side, as of last week, we have completed 97% of the previously announced reduction in force exercise of 8,000. This means that we have reduced our total payroll by 42% over the last 18 months since the 1st of January 2015. Given the current market context and the anticipated increase in activity levels, we have chosen to preserve capability to address the upcoming growth, which are in excess of the requirements of current activity levels. Such additional costs included in our quarterly results amount to $50 million, representing 350 basis points of margin and $0.05 in EPS terms.\\nI want to be clear on the cost reduction front. Should the industry environment abruptly change back to February levels and persist at those levels, we can eliminate this additional annualized retained cost of $200 million and, furthermore, collapse our operating structure materially to save even more costs. Such steps would be extreme and would impair our capability to grow in the future without additional investments.\\nBelow operating margins, R&D costs reduced by $5 million sequentially, while corporate costs were down $8 million, reflecting spending cuts in line with the reduced budgets. These levels are sustainable going forward. The tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 21% reflected the tax benefit on the losses, primarily in the U.S., partly offset by tax provisions internationally. The tax rate for 2016 will be dependent on the geographical mix of earnings and will be heavily weighted by results in the U.S. but could swing widely as a percentage rate as the levels of income are quite low. The second quarter results also included net after-tax charges of $312 million.\\nLet me go through the key charges. We took a charge of $101 million in litigation charges, mainly related to advancement in negotiations with the SEC regarding our income tax restatements from previous years. A charge of $84 million was taken to reflect the fair market value adjustment of a note receivable from a customer in Venezuela. While we intend to hold this note to maturity and collect on the entire face value and the associated interest, accounting rules mandate the write-down on this note to reflect its current market value. Over time, this value should continue to increase as commodity prices recover and maturity dates get nearer.\\nWe took a charge of $69 million from bond tender premiums that were paid related to the repurchase of our senior notes; a charge of $62 million, primarily from write-downs in inventory and other assets as we continue to resize the business; a charge of $41 million in severance and restructuring charges; and finally, a credit of $45 million of income relating to the Zubair legacy contract, reflecting the favorable terms of settlement reached with that customer.\\nThe good news is that, as of this print, the construction phase of this contract has been completed and is now in the routine operations and maintenance phase where we hand over the project to our customer while training them to operate the facilities. So it's quite routine now. So from now onwards, you will never again hear us talking about the Zubair contract.\\nMoving on to the near-term outlook. We expect a modest recovery in activity levels in the U.S., which has already seen a 7% quarter-to-date increase in rig count on land, augmented by the post-break-up seasonal recovery in Canada. Signs of increasing activity are already manifesting in the U.S., with two additional pressure pumping crews being deployed in July. In fact, we made 77 job offers last week to manage the staffing of these crews.\\nIt takes about three weeks currently to re-equip our stock fleet with minimal CapEx, but it takes up to six weeks to re-staff the fleet crew. Already, there are signs of a tightening labor market in the U.S. with many laid-off workers having left the oilfield workforce permanently to move to other sectors of the economy. While the initial recruitment will comprise experienced oilfield hands, beyond the point, retraining will be needed. All of this is going to reverse the pricing trend in the U.S., albeit gradually, as operators will have to pay more to access high-quality service capability.\\nAdditionally, with customers working through the duck or drill but uncompleted inventory, our completion and artificial lift activity levels will get a disproportionate boost on U.S. land. Internationally, we expect to see some flattening in Latin America, modest growth in the Europe/Caspian/Russia/Sub-Sahara Africa region, with the continued seasonal recovery into the summer in both Russia but to a lesser extent in Europe, aided further by market share gains in the Middle East and in some Asian markets.\\nPricing will not deteriorate any further from second-quarter levels but costs will continue to trend downwards. Based on this, we expect to see a gradual improvement in our second-half result, although on an overall basis, we do not expect to break even by year-end. Bernard will comment in more detail on the operating results, contract activity and wins and the outlook later on in this call.\\nMoving on to cash flow and net debt. Free cash flow in the second quarter was a disappointing negative $160 million, while still improving on the first quarter's free cash flow by $56 million. The shortfall can be explained quite simply. Customers in general, but particularly national oil companies, have begun to manage their cash flows actively, thereby delaying payments to contractors. We missed about $150 million in specific projected collections reflected in the nine-day increase in our DSO this quarter. Obviously, these customers have solid credit and recoverability is not in question. Just the timing is delayed. As our customers will benefit from better oil prices going forward, we expect them to improve their payment cycle in the second half of the year and into next year.\\nSecondly, with the reduction in product sales, we could not hit our inventory reduction targets in the second quarter. And while we did reduce inventory levels in the quarter, we fell short by $50 million.\\nThirdly, the tender offer we made on our 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 bonds resulted in a settlement on June 30 accelerating payment of accrued interest of $27 million, which would otherwise have been paid in the third quarter. And lastly, we also accelerated the reduction in force program and incurred an additional $28 million in cash severance payments. These factors impacted our second quarter free cash flow by about $250 million.\\nOur current forecast for free cash flow for the year is in the range of a positive $100 million to $150 million (13:14). This implies a seasonal recovery in our cash flow generation in the second half of the year, which is normal for our industry. Our second half cash flow will be bolstered by improved results, stronger customer collections, lower inventory levels, much lower severance cash costs, absence of employee annual bonus payments and continued discipline in capital spending.\\nCapEx is now targeted to be $200 million for the year, down another $50 million from the previous guidance. This low level of CapEx should not alarm anyone. Our CapEx is divided into three buckets: the manufacturing capacity, infrastructure capacity and technical equipment for our services business.\\nIn terms of manufacturing capacity, we are currently running at just over a third of available capacity. In terms of service infrastructure, we are well built out globally and are materially underutilized currently. And finally, on the technical equipment front, we have objective utilization metrics for each product line in place, be it drilling services, wireline logging or pressure pumping. And based on detailed analyses, we believe we can support about 2.5 times the current levels of activity without adding any meaningful higher CapEx. As we grow into the upcycle, we can and we will maintain a tight lid on CapEx.\\nNet debt increased by $187 million in the quarter to reach $6.8 billion. In the second quarter, we successfully upsized and issued $1.27 billion of convertible notes and $1.5 billion in five-year and seven-year senior debt at very good interest rates. A big part of these proceeds, totaling $1.9 billion, were used to buy back debt maturing in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, pursuant to the tender offer. And the rest of the proceeds were used to pay down the revolver.\\nAs a result of these transactions, our maturity profile has changed substantially, derisking the liquidity profile of the company materially. Prior to these transactions, we had $2.1 billion of maturities over the next three years. Today, this number is a mere $639 million, with only $88 million due in 2017 and only $66 million due in 2018. The success of these transactions reflects investor confidence, both in the recovery of the sector as a whole and in Weatherford's strong performance in the backdrop of such a sector recovery. We are grateful for our investors' faith in us and we expect to exceed their expectations.\\nOne point of particular note here is that this springing maturity clause in our revolver linked to reducing the 2019 $1 billion bond maturity to less than $500 million by the fourth quarter of 2018, has already been neutralized, as the outstanding amount of the 2019 bond is now only $485 million. This means that the revolver now extends out to July of 2019 with no problems.\\nAnother noteworthy item is that all of our banks recently unanimously approved an amendment to our revolver agreement to iron out kinks and to ease certain restrictions that make it easier for Weatherford to operate. Additionally, an accordion feature of up to $250 million was added to the agreement to allow existing and new lenders to extend more capacity to the company going forward. All of these changes are positive for Weatherford and demonstrate the continuing support from our banking group.\\nOur long-term net debt will trend down. Our current intention is that in 2021, when the convertible debt becomes due, we expect to issue shares to our debtholders in exchange. This will structurally reduce our debt by $1.27 billion. Additionally, positive free cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the eventual sale of the Land Rigs business will also reduce net debt materially. All of this goes to further delever and derisk the company. Longer term, we continue to target a 25% to 30% debt to cap ratio and recover our investment grade credit ratings. As of June 30, available liquidity was $1.8 billion, including $1.3 billion of revolver capacity and $452 million of cash balances.\\nOperating EBITDA for the quarter was flat with Q1 at $58 million. As to specified EBITDA as defined in our revolver agreement, it came in at $130 million for the quarter. The key specified debt to specified EBITDA ratio at June 30 was 1.0 times versus a covenant of 3.0 times, meaning we have ample headroom on the covenant. The same ratio including LCs was 2.04 times, which is also well below the covenant of 4.0 times. Our projections for the rest of the year suggest that we maintain the substantial headroom on the covenant.\\nIn conclusion, Weatherford is now materially derisked from a liquidity standpoint, has a clear achievable plan to delever over the next several years and the company is now at the takeoff point as the market recovers, with industry-leading earnings and cash flow incrementals.\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Bernard.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Krishna. Good morning, everyone. A few comments on Q2. The second quarter evolved as we expected. We thought NAM would trough, and it did. In spite of a devastating cover (19:30) in Q2, making a severe activity drop that much worse for NAM, operating income actually improved significantly. This is entirely due to cost management and excellent operating execution.\\nWe thought the Eastern Hemisphere would not deteriorate further in Q2 and this was correct. We have cross-currents in Q2 for the Eastern Hemisphere. Pricing concessions during our prior quarters impacted the quarter. This conflicted with some early startups and powerful cost cuts. The end result was marginal declines in overall revenues and flat profitability.\\nWe viewed Latin America as having a very weak prognosis. This proved also and unfortunately correct. Mexico, Colombia, our largest market, Brazil and even Argentina, all weakened further, in some instances, dramatically. By way of an illustration, our largest client in our largest national market, Colombia, moved their rig activity in late 2014 from 30 rigs within plan for over 40 to zero in this second quarter. In the course of the quarter, the client went actually down to zero drilling rigs.\\nQ2 showed exemplary decremental of 6%, an 11% decline in sequential revenues. We expect these will be industry-leading decrementals. They reflect above all the very aggressive cost actions taken from day one of the downcycle. We've had the best, as in lowest, decrementals, consistently. Lastly, Q2 was to be the last quarter with the ongoing Zubair project and it was. Zubair is completed. You won't hear of Zubair anymore. It is a closed issue.\\nOn cash flow, a long-term focus and objective, profitability, CapEx, inventory and cash payment of the 15 operating bonuses traditionally paid in Q2, all were by and large as planned. We had two unexpected events: accelerated Q3 payments into Q2 and delayed receivables collection.\\nThe acceleration of payments for severance execution was one of the two accelerations. Almost all the Q3 was pushed into Q2 as we accelerated our payroll cuts to end the layoff program earlier. Acceleration of three payments of Q3 interest expense in addition to Q2's scheduled interest payments. This is a byproduct of the debt tender offer.\\nDelayed receivables collection. As Krishna mentioned, the delays are all – well, they're all NOCs, a few IOCs, too. This isn't a credit or a collection issue. This is an industry phenomenon. Why did large clients slow down payments? Because they could. In Q2's extremely depressed environment, it was possible. The net result was a significant shortfall in scheduled collections at quarter's end. All this added up to $200 million, $250 million swing in our free cash flow. The swing isn't lost. It will benefit the second half of 2016.\\nQ2 synthesis and forward views. Looking at Q2, a few conclusions are clear to us. NAM profit in Q1 profitability wise and Q2 revenue wise. NAM is now turning, however slowly, but turning it is. Eastern Hemisphere crossed in Q2. Same observation. Eastern Hemisphere as a whole is turning, however slowly, but turning it is. Latin America will continue to remain challenged. We don't see it turning, not in 2016.\\nMore details on forward views, these comments apply to Weatherford. We incorporated market trends but with idiosyncratic specificity. We are a little different from the others. Only half our product lines overlapped the big three, essentially completion and formation evaluation and our recent market share history is also different.\\nFirst half of this year reflected the psychology of a $25 oil market, which is essentially a forced liquidation of the industry's capabilities. Volume activity worldwide and pricing conditions reached levels unseen in any management's lifetime, including this one. Second half of this year will reflect a $40, $45 oil market psychology, which will make it the beginnings of a recovery, albeit from extraordinarily low levels.\\nThe oilfield will slowly pull out of the extreme operating conditions it was placed under. Progress will occur, but step by step and not everywhere. Oil bears need not fret. The recovery will be short with a minimum activity levels required to sustain, let alone grow, a flat worldwide oil production capacity. This means on the whole our clients in the second half will continue to lower their oil production overall and de facto capacity. In effect, second half of this year, we won't be able to overcome decline rates either. Worldwide oil production capacity will be lower at year-end than it was at the end of Q2.\\nGeographically, activity gains will be predominantly land and concentrated in three regions: North America, MENA and Russia. The rest will, by and large, flatten out. NAM will slowly rise in activity with all segments benefiting. Completion and lift will be the strongest first beneficiaries as will pressure pumping. The capacity overhang in that segment limits their near-term potential. Completion, our completion, is seeing for the first time in many quarters an increase in orders and activity on a number of U.S. land plays.\\nOn lift, we have seen recent improvements in orders in new equipment, suggesting both the end of our client destocking and some activity increases. Lift prognosis matters for us in NAM. It is a very large and normally very profitable pipeline with low beta. But when conditions deteriorate to an extreme, as they recently have, lift, our lift, becomes much higher beta than understood.\\nLet me explain further. We are the largest payer worldwide, including North America, in all forms of lift, except ESPs. Normally, lift is an island of resilience and stability. With the unprecedented collapse of North American activity, lift experienced high beta with major client destocking of new and parts inventory, as well as severe curtailment of the new well market. This deterioration was much worse than the ESP segment because the types of wells ESPs address keep their low beta. As a correlation, our lift and our non-ESP lift peers have much more to recover with a turn in the market. De facto in this particular cycle, our NAM lift pipeline has become high beta.\\nEastern Hemisphere will arrest its decline volume-wise and experience a modest recovery. Expect the first manifest rise in activity late in Q3 and squarely in Q4. This will not apply to the entire hemisphere, Russia and MENA will show by far the most improvements, both a combination of activity increases and market share gains in our case. The Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Emirates, are the prime movers for us. Middle East will be an island of strength in the second half. There are also some Eastern Hemisphere markets that will lag, but at a minimum, these markets will stabilize with no further declines.\\nLatin America on the whole will start second half weak. It will flatten before year-end. The activity declines will arrest. But it will not experience much steady recovery, not this year. There will be shifts in national markets and clients, but overall, the prognosis of the market is for soft followed by flat outlook for the second half. That makes Latin America the laggard.\\nTwo targets we'll fight for. We may reach break-even profitability operating income in North America by first half of next year, first half 2017. On the back of high expected volume incrementals and the full effect of cost cuts, we assume in this respect very little improvements in pricing in that turnaround timeframe. Two, Eastern Hemisphere may return to double-digit operating income margin, albeit just low end of the double-digit in Q4 – this is, therefore, Q4 of this year – Q4 2016, on the back of high expected incrementals.\\nAnd again, much of the strong incrementals expected after the credit of the cost revolution at Weatherford, which brings me to cost and organizational change. I want to touch on a number of operational issues because I believe we are at a turning point in the cycle and the turning point of two-year cost and operating transformation. And I believe it portends a strong performance at Weatherford.\\nThe first half of the year, we have reduced our global employee count by another 7,800. Our full employee count stands today at just 32,000, down from 55,300 on January 1, 2015, 18 months ago. This is a 42% contraction of our total payroll in 18 months. The organization has been delayered on average by a third. The support ratio in direct-to-direct labor dropped further to 37.8%. Early in 2014, it stood at near 60%.\\nNo other statistic tells the story like the support ratio. This almost cutting in half was accomplished in the midst of a very sharp decline in direct head count, and it's extremely difficult to get done. Simply said, we have step-changed, as in made efficient, our support structure. We did this in addition to direct cost action, even though direct labor was hammered very hard. This is important because future incrementals will benefit immensely productivity turns. Our low support ratio will drive powerful absorption when volume increases.\\nResponsibility and accountability have been pushed to the sand face, as close to the field as possible, which means less Dubai, Singapore, Moscow, Houston, et cetera, more Dhahran, Sakhalin, U.K. and Midland, et cetera. Supply chain as in manufacturing, procurement, logistics have been restructured with efficiency gains at all levels. We made large gains in procurement and logistics already. Manufacturing is still in the process of being restructured but metrics for work center rates and times of delivery have already improved.\\nOperating and financial management have been upgraded thoroughly from the leadership through the ranks. It is self-evident at the leadership level. It runs deep through the ranks. HR has been empowered at all levels of the organization, with an emphasis on training and career development. Operational compensation is geared toward free cash flow returns, quality and safety. With the turn, return metrics become increasingly important, as will quality.\\nQ3, but even more so Q4, will capture the full benefit of all the cost actions taken, which brings me to forward operating priorities. Other than a few local exceptions, people and delayering cost reductions are completed. We're calling for an end to the payroll-related cost drive. There will not be any further contraction. The current level of 32,000 worldwide employees will be our low point. We are also calling for an end to all price discounting. This is a company-wide formal decision and process. No tender or bid submission will be priced lower than Q2 levels effective now. This is the first step towards price recovery.\\nOver time, price recovery will be a powerful driver of financial results. Pricing worldwide, not just North America, reached levels which we have never experienced before, not by a wide margin. Pricing levels are unsustainable long term for our industry. We are not banking on pricing alone to drive margin improvements. The level of support cost ratio at end of Q2 of 38.8% is so far from its historical levels of years ago with obviously (32:08) very high incrementals when high activity comes through, viewed as a particularly powerful absorption booster of high business volume.\\nOn the cost side, what will be left as a work in process are ongoing two-year productivity and efficiency internal projects centered around supply chain, maintenance cycles and invoicing processes, with powerful structural cost and cash flow efficiency implications. This will benefit 2017 and later years.\\nYou will notice we started to add a few operating news in our quarterly results, be they contract wins we view as directionally important or particular agreements, such as our joint effort with IBM. We've spent much over the last two years talking about layoffs, shutdowns and curtailments. When we didn't, we talked about liquidity, banking facilities and balance sheet constraints.\\nToday our capitalization is structurally safe, with action taken in June. We have ample liquidity and time. This doesn't change our financial priorities. The company's culture, compensation and focus is on free cash flow generation and returns as key metrics of performance. It is set. It is ingrained in our DNA and it won't change.\\nAlso, legacy issues, whether administrative, legal and contractual, are closed, and our cost structure is at an unprecedented low level, of which much is perennial. With all this achieved and all behind us, it is time we focused on clients, technology, product development and the impact we as a company can make on the industry. With our specialization and unique toolbox and technology capabilities we have, we have much to offer.\\nBy year end, Weatherford's maturation process, at least in our opinion, will be essentially completed. The company had years of extremely aggressive growth and development in its formative years. It had then many years of success, but it also paid a high administrative and operational price with speed and rate of growth. Even if all issues are closed, the lesson is learned.\\nAlong the way, our industry's unprecedented depression in depth and longevity allowed us to step-change faster and further when needed to be changed. That includes our cost structure, refocus on strengths, product line infrastructure and selected market share opportunities to the exclusion of all else. So it allowed us to adopt cash generation and return metrics as financial objectives throughout the organization and change our culture.\\nWith the overly aggressive earlier stages of the company part of our history buried and gone, all that Weatherford focused on financial priorities and operating performance. The market is turning. It feels slow, hesitant, frail, worrisome. But make no mistake, it is as frustrating as it will be powerful when some time has run. The oilfield service industry, our industry, is a coiled spring. And within the industry, Weatherford is especially tightly coiled.\\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A session.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. And your first question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nGood morning, guys.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nGood morning, Jim.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nGood morning, Jim.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nBernard, operationally it looked like a decent quarter, especially in North America. Internationally, you mentioned that the Middle East and Russia will show improvement in the second half, and you specifically mentioned contract wins. Can you tell us what product lines, what areas that you're winning contracts in in the international markets, especially in the Middle East these days?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nSaudi Arabia, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Oman would be essentially it. And in terms of product lines, it would be essentially drilling-related, drilling and with some completion add-ons.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nOkay. And Latin America, you note it's going to continue to lag obviously Mexico. Baker had a big blowup in Ecuador. I mean, everything seems to be stalled. Do you see Latin America coming back in 2017 or is this going to be a longer-term endemic issue?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nI think that places like Colombia, Argentina and, to a more limited degree, Mexico, will have an awakening in 2017. Nothing extravagant. Of course, it depends on oil, et cetera. I think Brazil will take a bit longer. And I cannot speak for Venezuela because there are financing issues there, so it's an unknown.\\nJames Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\\nOkay. Okay, gentlemen. Thanks much.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nThank you, Jim.\\nOperator\\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is open.\\nWilliam A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\\nThank you. Good morning.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nGood morning.\\nWilliam A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\\nBernard, could you expand on the recovery path for Eastern Hemisphere margins by year end? We're going effectively from break-even to low-double digits by year end. Are those basically costs that have already been taken out of the system that didn't necessarily manifest themselves on the P&L in the second quarter and should begin to blossom in Q3 and Q4?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nI think when you look at the margin expansion we're planning to get...\\nWilliam A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\\nYeah.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\n...which I agree is a big number if we are to achieve our targets, you will see that about a large third of it is driven by simply incorporation of the cost actions we took to the P&L.\\nWilliam A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\\nOkay.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nIt's not so much that we acted later throughout the Eastern Hemisphere. It just takes longer simply because of regulations and culture in those places. So our assessment, it was pretty good on the cost metrics, on figuring out what will happen. Our assessment, again, is that it will take just about full effect in Q4 and most of the effect in Q3. So Q3 will already benefit Q4 in full on the cost side and then drive a large third of the margin improvements that we're hoping to see in dollar terms.\\nThe balance at two-thirds or a small two-thirds is really nothing more but a measurement of the activity that we see as very – well, not only likely, but planned for. We are increasing volume of activity in a number of Middle Eastern markets. It's not a large number, but it's in a number of markets. We can measure what that means. We know the profitability of the contracts. And we can measure it. And if you add all of that, it provides us to a certain dollar margin for the fourth quarter, which combined with the costs, brings us to somewhere between 10% to 11% very specifically, operating income margins for MENAP because Asia Pacific is combined with it. Asia will not change very much.\\nWilliam A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\\nRight.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nA little bit of cost benefit, but not change very much. So it's all driven by MENA. And so we see that – which allows us to say that we can see that particular part of our business being driven to our double-digit results.\\nWilliam A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\\nOkay. So to be clear, the double-digit aspiration is for MENAP and not necessarily Eastern Hemisphere?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nNo. It's Eastern Hemisphere. I just covered the part of it that...\\nWilliam A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\\nOkay. Got it. All right.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThe rest case is seasonal in the case of Russia, which is very powerful. And look at cost cuts. Cost cuts and seasonal. The European side doesn't move that much in terms of activity. It's just cost.\\nWilliam A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\\nOkay.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nSo the one that was more granular was MENA. Forgive me.\\nWilliam A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\\nOkay. Thanks. And in the second line of inquiries here is, I think Krishna referenced putting two fleets back to work in North America in July. And I just want to drill down a little bit on your frac fleet in North America. I think you have something along the order of, kind of 900,000 horsepower in North America and, first, how much of that is working? Second, what's the health of the fleet? And I'm just kind of wondering about how much of your idle capacity can go back to work in short order with a minimal amount of CapEx.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nSo I'll cover some of the aspects and, Krishna, fill in the blanks. We have, originally, 23 spreads and we would calibrate the spread at just about 50,000 horsepower a piece, a bit more than 900,000 horsepower in the U.S. However, we feel today we only have 20 there realistically. Out of the 20 spreads, so it would be 1 million horsepower, rather than the prior number, we have 10 which is hot-stacked. Well, 10 market and also hot-stacked, and 10 which is cold-stacked. The 10 that are hot-stacked went all the way down to five operating as recently as Q2 and the five becomes seven.\\nSo if you will, seven out of 10 are active, seven actually under contract and three which are ready to go, assuming we can find the crews. The other 10 cold-stacked are being minimally maintained. They're not just being – they're not being dilapidated. They're not being sort of cannibalized and the rest of it. There is a CapEx involved with the other 10, which Krishna will cover.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nThanks, Bernard. So yeah, first of all, to bring the three hot-stacked fleets back on there's minimal. Absolutely. We're talking about three weeks' time to bring those fleets back to work with very, very minimal expenditure. The cold-stacked fleets will, roughly, take about $5 million to $7 million each, with about a four-week turnaround time to bring each fleet back. So we could work on all those fleets concurrently of course. So really, the CapEx needed, additional CapEx needed to bring the 10 cold-stacked fleets back to work is actually quite minimal for a company of our size. And we are very cognizant of the market, working closely with our customers and we should be able to react quite quickly to any kind of upswing in the market.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nTo put it in perspective, Bill, think on the cold-stacked which is half of our fleet, the 10 out of the 20, about $150 of horsepower on average to bring them back to the market. They have been, again, minimally maintained. They have not been cannibalized.\\nWilliam A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\nOperator\\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\nSean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC\\nHey. Good morning.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nGood morning, Sean.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nGood morning.\\nSean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC\\nSo just looking to expand on that discussion on the pumping fleet, as you think about the restart of activity and the impact of pricing, I think you noted in the prepared remarks some tightening of labor. Just curious as you think about pricing progression, do you expect to see some concessions from your customers on pass-through cost first before you can get toward the net pricing? Just curious how that dynamic will play out as activity were to pick up?\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nSo, Sean, you are absolutely right on that. It is a utilization story. In North America, the way the recovery unfolds, which you know very well, is you start getting more fleets back to work. The overall utilization of the U.S. fleet, not just our fleet, but industry fleet, has to reach a certain threshold before we then start gradually renegotiating terms and conditions, which include pass-through, et cetera.\\nThat's how the pricing improvement starts manifesting. Eventually at some point, when the market picks up to a certain threshold, then you start having a little bit tightness both in equipment and in labor in terms of shortage. That's when you start getting a little bit more pricing power. But we don't envisage anything in our assumptions on pricing for the rest of this year.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nSean, also be careful that – be careful, be mindful more so than careful, that in the breadth of our product lines lift, completion, well construction and so forth, we've had absolutely also terrible pricing and you're probably a bit more likely to see our pricing – I wouldn't say strong pricing, no, but some pricing move in the other products and service lines rather than pressure pumping. Pressure pumping will really be initially by our assessment utilization game for quite some time, until you get to a level of utilization where it's more natural to get some pricing relief.\\nSean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC\\nRight. I think that's fair. And then just to circle back on the updated free cash flow guidance, there's some moving parts. I was just hoping you could give us a little more detail, particularly I was thinking around the working capital, how that component's going to help you achieve those targets for the second half.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nRight. So, first of all, receivables, we should – I mentioned that NOCs are managing their cash flow actively. This is an industry thing. It's not a Weatherford thing. And we expect that to continue through the second half. We think NOCs worldwide are going to continue to manage their cash flow quite actively through to the end of the year. So the DSO will stay where it is, but obviously, the collections in the second half will exceed that. That's on a prorated basis, what we saw in the second quarter.\\nInventory levels initially for the first, I would say, six to none months starting now, will actually dip because there will be a step-up in activity. That's our assumption based on what we're seeing in the marketplace. So you'll see inventory levels dip a little bit before we need to start restocking. Restocking will start some time mid next year.\\nSo in terms of working capital, we expect to see some inventory declines. We expect to see an increase, marginal increase in receivable balances and payables will go with the business. If a business goes up, the payables will increase as we go forward, allowing us to manage the receivables from a liquidity perspective. So it'll be a little bit of a mixed bag, I would say, kind of flattish working capital for the next six months to nine months and then gradual increase after that as the business picks up to a new level\\nSean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC\\nGot it. Understood. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Your line is open.\\nJ. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\\nHello, gentlemen. I want to drill down on your ability to respond in an upturn. I think, Krishna, you mentioned that activity would need to improve 2.5 times before you need meaningful CapEx? First of all, did I hear that right? And how does that apply by product line and by geographic areas? Is North America going to be the same? For example, 2.5 times where we are today is 1,100 rigs before you really need to spend any CapEx.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nI'll give some element of comment for Marshall and Krishna will add. It's actually even a bit more than that. The manufacturing capabilities can accommodate three times more volume, not two-and-a-half. The infrastructure, which is a bit of an artificial measurement, the roofline that we developed over the year is so wide and actually, so – is get up a much higher volume, can also accommodate throughput three times the volume that we presently have easily. The 2.5 times concerns the tool deployed in the field. Whether it's completion service tools or whether it's LWD kits at both ends of the spectrum, that's what Krishna was referring to and all of these numbers are absolutely correct.\\nWe actually do not need to expand manufacturing or infrastructure, period, in the foreseeable future because three times the volume, even in a recovery, is a lot. In terms of the service tools that I just mentioned and all the formation evaluation tools, as you can tell also, 2.5 times is a vast number. In addition to which I will tell you, we are improving really by a large measure the intensity of use of our tools, which if anything, will tend to make the 2.5 times bigger number and all last longer, if you will. As volume comes in, we'll still have that kind of ability to accommodate more business.\\nSo CapEx, we're not starving the business. It's not the business, which is being deprived of anything. The reality is we have very long assets. We can use assets. We are using assets. We've learned how to do that intelligently and although CapEx with activity obviously will grow, you'll be surprised by how modest it is and it's not worth suppressing our capabilities at all. It's just that we spent much in past years and it has not been wasted. That's really all. Krishna, do you want to add to that?\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nYeah, I'd like to add, just to give some context here as well. In the last two years or so, we have immensely strengthened the management of our product lines. People in the field, the product line people in the field, they have asset-sharing objectives and that cultural change has happened nicely over the last two years. So today, they all carry a global CapEx objective by product line. Every product line has got utilization metrics, which are now embedded, people understand them and sharing of tools is one aspect of it.\\nThe other aspect of it is to localize the repairs and maintenance. So we have opened up R&M centers locally in many geographies in the last two years. What this does is that when a tool goes down after using it in a job, it gets now maintained and repaired locally and is redeployed immediately back in the field from where it came as opposed to the past when it would have to come back to Houston or go back to the U.K. It would take months and months of turnaround time, which means you had to have a huge number of backup tools in every country to cope with that R&M kind of facility that we had, in the centralized facility that we had.\\nNow, having localized everything, we have much more confidence in telling you that we don't need that many backup tools as before. This is part of the transformation of Weatherford, just the way we are managing our global fleet of tools, the way we are managing the deployment of tools and the repair and maintenance of tools. So all of this goes into the kind of statistic that I was talking about, 2.5 times.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nWe manage our costs down. We talk a lot about it because it's easy to measure people. What we don't talk as much about is the quality of the people and the priorities they have or the operating guidelines they have or the culture change. We also don't talk as much either as to the work we've done on around the assets, understanding the asset base we have, understanding how to use it more efficiently. There's enormous amounts of headroom in us doing that, but we've done all three at the same time. We just put the emphasis on just the raw numbers of people leaving and the cost measurement because it's just easier to get your head around it.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nSo really, our ability to manage the upswing in terms of physical tools and CapEx is actually very, very strong without meaningfully adding to CapEx and eroding our cash flow going forward.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nAnd in closing, that doesn't have anything to do with availability of capital. It has to do with returns. That was a returns-driven initiative.\\nJ. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\\nIt was a surprisingly high number and that's good color and helps me understand how you get there. The other surprising thing that I heard was I think, Krishna, you mentioned you're already starting to see a little bit of a tightening in the labor side, maybe six weeks to re-staff a frac crew today. If activity is, let's say, 30%, 50% higher than today, how long do you think it'd take you to hire out and train a crew?\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nWe are not alone in this. Our peers are also recruiting hand over fist right now or to staff some few additional crews that they're putting out there. So I think, frankly, as an industry – there's no empirical verification of this, of course – but I would say the first 25%, 30%, 40% increase, physical activity, it'll be fairly straightforward to recruit back some of the labor that have been laid off.\\nAfter that, it'll get really tight. So I would say up to 600 oil rigs, it should be fairly easy. After that, it gets tighter. So we will reach a situation where we tell the customers we have the equipment but we have less people. We don't have people to run it. And that's what I was talking about in my prepared comments that the crunch will come on people first, then it'll come on equipment much later.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nYou know, Marshall, at the end of the day, what he means is the elasticity response of North America on the oil side, meaning on the production, on the capacity side, is overstated. The simple reason that – forget the reservoir issues and whether the other zones we can go after are as productive as the ones we're going after and blah, blah, blah. Forget that. That's one issue.\\nBut the other issue is just the sheer ability for the industry to bounce back. Of course, it will. Will take much longer. It is not normal, the depression we went through. It lasted much longer, much, much, much longer. It's already twice as long as 2009 and deeper. And there are consequences, and the consequences is measured with the elasticity of response.\\nJ. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\\nAnd presumably, that's when pricing goes hyperbolic when you start to run into those bottlenecks.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, that's not what we want as an industry. But that's correct. We don't make the rules.\\nJ. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.\\nThank you.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\\nWaqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.\\nThank you, and good morning from New York here.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nGood morning.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nGood morning, Waqar.\\nWaqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.\\nJust quickly on the Zubair. I guess last time around, the $150 million of settlement, have you received proceeds for that or when do you expect them, if not already?\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nSo we signed a settlement agreement with them, Waqar. And really, they're following the settlement agreement to the letter. So we received $60 million in the second quarter. And offsetting that was operating expenses because we had operations, which have now finished, in the second quarter. But the rest of the money, most of it will come in the third quarter, as negotiated and agreed. And that's part of our second half cash flow forecast.\\nWaqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.\\nThat's great. That's all I have. Thank you very much.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nThank you very much.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Waqar.\\nOperator\\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open.\\nKurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC\\nHey, guys. Good afternoon where you guys are, huh?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nGood morning. Good morning. Good morning.\\nKurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC\\nThank you. Thank you. Good thing. So I just wanted to follow up on two things. First, focus on the cash flow dynamic you guys outlined, what you expect for the full-year cash flow generation. Just wondering how you guys are risk assessing getting to that cash flow number in that context and maybe what percentage of working capital is going to represent that cash flow.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nSo, obviously, there's a number of elements in our second-half cash flow guidance. We see an improvement in earnings, as Bernard mentioned in his comments, with growth both in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere, excluding Latin America. Latin America is not going to grow. And there's also, of course, the working capital release, both mainly from inventories really and some amount of receivables as well just flowing through from the Q2.\\nAnd I think from a risk assessment standpoint, these are the main assumptions we have because the rest of it, the severance is going to go down because we've accelerated much of it into the second quarter. Interest payments actually will go down as well in cash terms because, again, because of the acceleration into the second quarter. And the Zubair contract will be cash positive, more so in the second half, much more so than in the first half. So when you aggregate all of the moving pieces, these are the things – most of it should happen as planned.\\nI think from a risk standpoint, commodity prices, activity levels, et cetera, those are the elements of it. But I'd like to mention that no matter what the numbers are, the implications are completely dampened now because from a liquidity and capital structure standpoint, as we mentioned earlier, and the covenant management, there is no issue at all.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nSo let's summarize, Kurt. I'll add a couple of things also if you want to get more comfort, which is that we always have a large operating bonus payment in Q2, every Q2 of every year. It's in the range of $18 million. It occurs in one quarters, in Q2. This is the routine. But it won't occur in Q3, Q4. There you are. The other thing, also, as you take a look, for no particular reason, the individual agreements, tables were taken down quite a lot in Q2 also. These are all obvious things you'll see fine.\\nSo I will mention also so that's one set of factors. And Krishna is right. We're not a company which has any issues of either liquidity or anything like that. We have now the kind of capital structure that we want and we do feel that we can take the net debt number down to, if you analyze the numbers, to $4 billion as a matter of three different events, which is free cash flow and the sale of assets, which is rigs. And also in our minds, we believe the conversion of the convertible into equity takes you down just mechanically very easily to $4 billion. And from there on, we'll take it down further.\\nSo it's all very clear. Do not assume, though, because we believe that the measurement of free cash flow is not the critical only measurement that matters at Weatherford anymore. Don't presume that we don't have within the organization ingrained in everyone's metrics the importance of free cash flow. That won't change precisely because we intend to make generous free cash flow in the years ahead, not just in the second half of the year. This is perennial. So don't assume because we say this that we don't view free cash flow generation as critical when we run the company. This is actually the measurement of success long term of any company.\\nKurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC\\nOkay. That's great.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nKurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC\\nAnd then, not yet. My follow-up is, so you mentioned break-even in a couple of different contexts. One on operating income, I think that was related specifically to North America. And then, Krishna, I think your reference to break-even was on an earnings per share basis. Can you guys clarify?\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nWhat I put forth is what we see internally, which is we see a path towards North America going from what was $100 million negative operating profit in Q2, which is better than Q1 to being break-even. That's one. And we see that occurring the first half of next year, Q1 or Q2.\\nA number of reasons for that and, of course, it depends also on oil being reasonable and so forth and so on. But a lot of it are things we control. This is one thing. What Krishna mentioned, separate and distinct, is simply the fact that he doesn't see – and he's right – how we can predictably be able to make enough of a progress to be able to be break-even this year.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nYeah, that's right.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nIt doesn't mean numbers will not get better. They won't be the same. They will get better. The question is, can we go from where we are, $0.28 negative to break-even, which is I think urgently needed. We'll get there. We don't think we'll get there by Q4, unfortunately, but the numbers will be better. That's what Krishna was conveying.\\nKrishna Shivram - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\\nRight.\\nKurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC\\nThank you.\\nBernard J. Duroc-Danner - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you very much. I think we have to close the Q&A session. There's a lot of calls today from our peers and just to allow people to attend the other calls, we'll just close it here. Thank you very much, everyone, for your time.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.\",\n",
