       "  \"Operator: Good morning, and welcome to today's ConAgra Foods First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This program is being recorded. My name is Jessica Morgan, and I'll be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host from ConAgra Foods for today's program; Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer; and Johan Nystedt, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Nystedt.\\nJohan Nystedt: Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. And while we are making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which include cautionary language. Also we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found either in the earnings press release, Q&A or on our website at investor.conagrafoods.com, click Financial Reports & Filings, then Non-GAAP Reconciliations. Now I'll turn it over to Sean.\\nSean Connolly: Thanks, Johan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter conference call. This will be our last earnings call as ConAgra Foods as we anticipate completing the Lamb Weston spin-off this fall prior to the holidays. As you've probably seen by now, we announced the timing of dedicated Investor Days for each business. Lamb Weston's will be held in New York City on October 13, and ConAgra Brands will be held on October 18 here in Chicago. Our teams are hard at work preparing for these meetings, and we are excited about the opportunity to take you through a deeper dive on these businesses and why we believe they will create significant value for investors as separate pure-play public companies. Each company will share more details, including financial outlooks and capital allocation priorities at these events. We are confident you will see the unique opportunities available to both companies and why each is well positioned to seize them. Now on to the state of the business and our first quarter results. Once again, it was a very busy quarter at ConAgra as we continue our disciplined and methodical approach to enhancing focus, expanding margins, improving efficiency, energizing our culture and ultimately, creating value for our shareholders. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with the progress that we have made to date. At a high level, we saw strong results from both Lamb Weston and our branded consumer businesses. On Lamb, we once again saw what a terrific business this is. Sales were up, margins were up and profit was up. The team is looking forward to sharing much more about this jewel of a business on October 13. On our branded consumer businesses, we also made terrific progress. Here, we are seeing clear evidence that our strategy to upgrade our revenue base and expand margins is working. As we have discussed previously, we are intensely focused on positioning our U.S. branded portfolio for long-term success and that starts with building a higher-quality revenue base. As we will discuss in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we compete in good categories with many well-known brands that are Number 1 or Number 2 in their categories. However, ConAgra historically prioritized volume over value and accordingly, we've been overly reliant on deep discounting as our chief demand driver, leading us to under-invest and under-deliver on brand building and innovation. In short, we underleveraged some of our greatest assets. The result of this behavior is a revenue base that is overdeveloped in terms of the presence of low-loyalty, price-focused consumers. The problem with catering to these consumers is that, (a) it caused us to neglect the needs of the vast majority of our consumer base, people who are hungry for innovation and premiumization and, (b) it fundamentally limited our ability to drive higher margins. We are changing that. Specifically, to ensure we leverage our brand strength and unlock our margin potential, we have been methodically infusing focus and discipline around pricing and trade promotion while investing in brand building and innovation. Said differently, we are focusing our efforts on practices that support value over volume and walking away from our previous practices that concentrated on volume over value. It is important to understand that while our efforts to improve brand building and innovation are broad-based, the volume declines we're experiencing are largely concentrated within brands that historically targeted the price-focused consumer and heavily relied on deep discounts and promotion to drive volume. In fact, if you dig into the scanner data, you will see that more than 80% of our Q1 volume declines can be attributed to just six brands that have historically been underpriced and over-promoted. We are confident that our actions represent the right way to maximize the value of our branded portfolio over time. As a supporting data point, gross margins on our U.S. retail brands are up about 700 basis points since Q1 two years ago. As we continue to execute this strategy, we believe our revenue base will be better positioned to deliver stronger, more consistent performance over the long term. We have framed our efforts here around five portfolio management principles, or PMPs as we call them, which guide how we intend to manage our branded portfolio going forward. At our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we will go deep on each of these, but I want to give you a sense of our approach. PMP number 1 is upgrading the revenue base. The second PMP is refreshing the core. PMP number 3 is assigning clear portfolio roles. The fourth PMP is ramping up innovation and M&A. And the fifth PMP is effectively backing the winners. These principles represent a tried-and-true approach and in a few weeks we will discuss the progress we're making on each and how they will help build a more focused, higher-margin and higher-performing branded food company over time. One note on PMP number 4, ramping up innovation and M&A. I'm sure you've all seen the news from earlier this week about our acquisition of the Frontera, Red Fork and Salpica brands. These businesses make authentic gourmet Mexican food and contemporary American cooking sauces. We believe this gives us another great platform to provide consumers with unique, high-quality food products. And as an extra enticement to attend our Investor Day on October 18, I promise you will have a chance to sample these tremendous brands. While we have a lot more work to do, I want to acknowledge our sales force for doing an excellent job working with our retailers to explain how our change in strategy benefits them as well as ConAgra. Similarly, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team for anticipating these volume changes and proactively offsetting any loss absorption benefits. With that context in mind, let's turn to our Q1 results. Q1 net sales declined 5% and the impact of divestitures and FX represented about 2 percentage points of the decline. As I mentioned at the outset, Lamb Weston delivered another strong top line this quarter, offset by sales results in our domestic consumer business. In the U.S. consumer market, which, as you know, is challenged across our competitive set, we saw declines due to the actions I just outlined related to upgrading our revenue base. This, along with the impact of FX, more than offset an increase in price and mix. Overall profitability was driven by growth and margin expansion in Lamb Weston as well as continued strong gross margin expansion in our domestic consumer businesses. As a result, total segment adjusted operating profit was up 23%. Additionally, our supply chain team continues to excel at finding more efficient ways to manufacture our products and reduce costs. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.61 for the quarter, representing 49% growth from the prior year, significantly in excess of our mid to high teens growth estimate. As Dave will point out, some of this is timing related. Now turning to segment performance. As you saw in this morning's release, we are now reporting results in five reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, the Refrigerated & Frozen, the International and the Foodservice segments represent the businesses that will remain with ConAgra Brands and will become the primary four reporting segments of the independent company postspin. The Commercial segment consists primarily of the Lamb Weston business.  Starting with the Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales decreased 5% based on the actions I just discussed. These efforts, coupled with increased pricing and trade productivity, savings and supply chain and continued SG&A discipline, helped drive growth of 31% in adjusted segment operating income, which translated to a 680 basis points expansion in adjusted segment operating margin. The volume declines in this segment were largely concentrated on a few brands where we are reversing our historical practice of promoting below the $1 price point. Chef Boyardee, and Snack Pack are good examples. Importantly, we saw the margin and profit expansion that we were counting on. Equally important, key sales fundamentals like distribution remained on plan reflecting customer support for our strategy shift towards stronger brands and innovation. Keep in mind, the plan does include some important SKU rationalization. So when you see TPDs pull back in the near term, recognize that is part of a disciplined program to reduce non-value-added complexity while increasing facings and velocity on priority SKUs. You'll hear more about this at our ConAgra Brands Investor Day in Dave Biegger's supply chain presentation.  Last point I'll make in this segment is that we continue to benefit from disciplined investment behind A&P-ready brands, such as Slim Jim and PAM among others. Now turning to the Refrigerated & Frozen segment. Net sales decreased 8% while adjusted operating profit increased by 310 basis points to 16% of net sales. The volume decline in this segment was heavily focused on Banquet, an important brand, as you know, is going through a significant makeover. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work to restage our Banquet brand resulting in increased pricing associated with long-overdue product and packaging upgrades. Accordingly, this was the primary driver of the volume and sales decline in the segment for the quarter. Banquet is now benefiting from much stronger margins, and our consumer data is also showing an improving buying rate from our most loyal consumers and key customers. As we move through the next calendar year and begin to wrap these actions, you will see top line sales declines moderate. From there, we will also fold in new product improvements and innovation. Regarding segment profitability here in Q1, our disciplined pricing actions and supply chain productivity more than offset the Banquet impact and the costs related to a product recall. One other planned action in Q1 is worth noting in Frozen. While Marie Callender's is not one of our historically over-promoted brands, it was over-promoted in the year-ago period. And that was not a good business decision, so we did not repeat it in Q1 this year. These two contributed to our volume decline, but, again, we saw the margin gains we were counting on. Elsewhere in the segment, we saw solid top line performance, namely in Reddi-wip, which continues to be a strong performer for us. The International segment, net sales decreased 6% due to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the effects of currency, segment net sales would have been approximately equal to the prior year's comparable quarter. Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 1%, and adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $24 million. This segment was negatively affected by normalization of egg prices after last year's avian influenza outbreak. Overall, the four segments that will primarily comprise ConAgra Brands' ongoing operation postspin have made good progress, demonstrating the strength of our plan and the opportunity that lies ahead. Much of our team have completed their first full quarter in our new headquarters in Chicago, at the Merchandise Mart, and there is tremendous energy and excitement to build upon our momentum as a pure-play branded company. Now turning to Commercial foods. As I said at the outset of my remarks, Lamb Weston delivered another great quarter, generating approximately 4% net sales growth. In our reported results, the strength of Lamb Weston's performance is masked by the fact that we include the impact of the divestures of Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank, which were completed at the end of July. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 33% in the quarter behind Lamb Weston's continued growth and favorable input costs. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, leveraging its strong brand to capture emerging markets and international growth. Tom and the Lamb team look forward to sharing much more during their Investor Day on October 13 in New York. Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our talented employees. Amidst significant change, including a successful move to our new headquarters, our team remained focused on delivering our goals and serving our customers. In addition to driving strong performance, our team is also dedicated to being a good corporate citizen, and we were honored to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the sixth consecutive year, demonstrating recognition of our commitment to environmental and social goals in addition to economic objectives. Now turning to one of our newest team members, I would like to welcome our new CFO, Dave Marberger, who joins us from Prestige Brands. Dave brings more than 30 years of finance and leadership experience to ConAgra Foods, including ten years as the CFO at Godiva Chocolatier and Tasty Baking Company. I first got to know Dave during his time with the Campbell Soup Company, and Dave is a proven and accomplished finance executive, and I am confident he will be a tremendous asset going forward. We are extremely happy to welcome him to the team. With that, Dave, over to you.\\nDave Marberger: Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my comments, I would like to say how energized I am to be part of this organization and leadership team. I look forward to getting to know many of you and the investor community in the weeks and months ahead. I will address several topics in my comments, including our new reporting segments; a recap of our 2017 fiscal first quarter performance; a summary of items impacting comparability, including some brief comments on goodwill impairment, cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet; and some brief comments on our upcoming Investor Day. As we outlined in the release, we now report our business results in five segments. They are Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments were previously included in our Consumer Foods segment and Foodservice was previously included in our Commercial Foods segment. Upon the completion of the Lamb Weston spin, the commercial segment will include only the historical results of JM Swank and Spicetec through the divestiture date, and the Lamb Weston results will be reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. Now I will provide some comments on our performance for our fiscal 2017 first quarter. Please note that references to adjusted earnings or operating profit referred to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Overall, net sales for the fiscal first quarter approximated $2.7 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter. The divestiture of JM Swank and Spicetec and the negative impact of foreign exchange accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the net sales decline versus the year-ago quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fiscal first quarter of $0.42 compared with $0.38 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.61, 49% above the $0.41 delivered in the year-ago quarter and better than we planned. The strong first quarter EPS performance primarily reflects the benefits from continued gross margin expansion, lower SG&A expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume, lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture and some costs related to a product recall. As I will discuss later, the first quarter overdelivery versus our plan was driven, in part, by timing items for both SG&A and A&P expense. In our Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $757 million for the quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 6% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $185 million in the first quarter versus $142 million in the year-ago quarter. The strong increase in adjusted profit reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts, driven by pricing discipline and favorable product cost and productivity; reduced SG&A costs; and lower A&P spending due to timing, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume. In our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, net sales were $605 million for the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago period, reflecting an 11% decline in volume and a 3% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $97 million in the first quarter versus $85 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in adjusted profit reflects the same continued progress on margin expansion efforts as outlined for the Grocery & Snacks segment, offset by approximately $9 million of costs related to a product recall. In our International segment, net sales were $195 million for the quarter, down 6% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 2% decline in volume, a 1.5% improvement in price mix and a negative 5% impact from foreign exchange. We reported a segment operating loss of $149 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by a pretax impairment charge of $164 million related to our Canadian business. I'll say more about this shortly. Adjusted segment operating profit was $15 million in the first quarter versus $17 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in adjusted profit reflects lower sales in gross margins and a negative impact from FX, partially offset by modestly lower A&P and SG&A expenses. In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $268 million for the quarter, down 1% from the year-ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $24 million in the first quarter versus $26 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower sales in gross margins, partially offset by lower A&P and SG&A expenses. In the Commercial segment, net sales were $843 million or 2% below the prior year quarter, driven by the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures. Lamb Weston had a very solid quarter as net sales increased 4% versus the prior year quarter. The commercial segment's adjusted operating profit was $148 million versus $112 million in the year-ago quarter. This strong increase was driven primarily by the net sales growth and margin expansion in our Lamb Weston business, partially offset by the profit decline resulting from the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures during the quarter. We realized proceeds of $486 million from these divestitures and recognized an aggregate book gain of approximately $198 million. We expect to utilize the capital loss tax asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to these divestitures. In addition to the segment information, I will also note the following matters related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $24 million for the current quarter and $37 million in the year-ago period. The decline principally reflects lower profits from our Ardent Mills joint venture. Adjusted corporate expenses were $38 million in the fiscal quarter versus $66 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts, along with lower costs related to the timing of certain expenses that will come later in the fiscal year. Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $69 million, down 18% from the prior year quarter. Most of this decline was due to the timing of expense that will be incurred later in the fiscal year. Despite this lower spend, total gross rating points for our A&P investments were up 7% for the first quarter versus a year ago, reflecting improved efficiency. For the first quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $11 million and operating profit by $4 million versus the year-ago quarter. Moving on to our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making very good progress and expect to realize the remainder of our $200 million of SG&A savings over the next two years as planned. While we saw significant benefits from SG&A savings in the first quarter, I would point out that some of this benefit was due to the timing of certain expenses moving to later in the fiscal year. We estimate that the benefit from timing for SG&A was $25 million to $30 million in the first quarter. I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter. We had $0.34 per diluted share of net expense related to impairment charges. Approximately $140 million pretax relates to impairment of goodwill and approximately $24 million pretax relates to impairment of intangible brand assets, both related to our Canadian business. The charges are principally the result of several factors. First, the change in our reporting segments now requires us to evaluate goodwill at a lower level. In the past, under the previous reporting segments, we were only required to evaluate goodwill at the total International business level. We are now required to evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit within the International segment. Second, while the performance of our International business has been steady over the last several years on a constant currency basis, the significant weakening of the Canadian dollar has negatively impacted the value of the Canadian business on a U.S. dollar basis, which is used for the goodwill analysis. Finally, the brand impairment reflects both the unfavorable foreign exchange movements as well as some weaker top line trends in this portion of the business. In addition to the impairment charges, we recognized $0.17 per diluted share of net gain from the sale of the JM Swank and Spicetec businesses. We also recognized $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. And finally, we recognized approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net benefit from favorable adjustments to state tax assets. Moving on to cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $795 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the first quarter were $337 million versus $64 million in the year-ago quarter. This significant increase is due to the improved operating earnings in the current quarter and higher-than-normal income tax payments in the year-ago quarter. For the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $117 million versus $102 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter due to the paydown of debt during the past 12 months. For the quarter, we paid down approximately $554 million of long-term debt, and dividends for this fiscal quarter were $110 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $86 million, and we had approximately $46 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter. We continue to remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments. Lastly, our estimated effective tax rate for income from operations remains at 33.5% for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. The first quarter reported tax rate was higher primarily from the tax impacts of the noncash impairment charge and the gain on the sale of JM Swank and Spicetec. As we have noted in the release, we are not providing any comments on our outlook today. Instead, we will provide more information on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and the long-term algorithm for both ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston at our upcoming Investor Days. We are excited about the opportunities to create value for both of these companies. This concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I, along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session.\\nAndrew Lazar: Just two questions on gross margin, if I could. In the quarter, gross margins expanded about 200 basis points and recognizing pricing and trade spend discipline and some input costs favorability were some key drivers, I guess, was any of this due to maybe some supply chain initiatives that may have been taken but not maybe yet talked too publicly? Or is more of that on-the-come, so to speak? And I then I've just got a follow-up.\\nSean Connolly: Well, we'll talk quite extensively, Andrew, about our plans with supply chain when we get to Investor Day. But on gross margin, obviously, there are a number of different things that are contributing to the gains we are seeing and the gain -- the size of the gains do vary quarter-to-quarter. But the important fact is that, over the past two years, we've made tremendous progress at gross margin and operating margin, and you saw that again this quarter. Quarter-to-quarter, the progress may vary due to a number of factors, but what I'm focused on is that we continue to move the centerline of our profitability north over time, while reducing the standard deviation around that centerline. On supply chain, look, first of all, clearly, the overall goal of our collective efforts is value and margin maximization. And supply chain productivity programs have always been, and will continue to be, an important component of that. And as Dave Biegger will share at our upcoming ConAgra Brands Investor Day, strong productivity has been a legacy strength at ConAgra, and you saw some of that also this quarter. We do have a strong track record of continuous improvement in terms of network optimization, procurement, T&W, et cetera, and now that we're upgrading our volume base and reducing low-margin business, we are providing a better foundation to build off of, as we plan for future margin accretive innovation. And Dave has obviously brought a fresh perspective around how to sustain that strong historic supply chain performance and build on it even further, and he'll share those views in a few weeks.\\nAndrew Lazar: Got it. And that leads into my next one, which is based on some of the filings of Form 10s and such, it shows that ConAgra Brands will have a or does have a gross margin that is certainly substantially -- despite the progress, right, substantially lower than the large cap peer group. And I guess, I'm just curious, and I know you'll talk more about this in couple weeks, but is there any, I guess -- or how much of that gap, let's say, with the group do you see as maybe structural? Or any reason that this gap, I guess, can't be significantly narrowed over time? And is it something we'll hear more about perhaps at the Investor Day?\\nSean Connolly: Yes, it certainly will be, and if you picked up on one of the comments I made, Andrew, in my prepared remarks, if you look at our branded businesses in the U.S. as an example, you've seen margin improvement of about 700 basis points versus the same quarter two years ago. So clearly, we believe and we demonstrated that we can do the things necessary to expand those margins and by no means do we think our work is done. We will continue to chip away at that, and we'll do it using a number of different factors. And we talked about those factors but, hopefully, investors are getting a sense of how relentless we are in terms of pursuing margin expansion.\\nOperator: And we'll take a question now from David Driscoll with Citigroup.\\nDavid Driscoll: I wanted to ask just a little reconciliation on the quarter itself. So the timing issue was, I think, you said $30 million, so that's something like $0.05, and then the lower tax rate was maybe worth another $0.04. So is it correct that maybe if you think about this quarter, let's say, a $0.54, it's still a very solid beat over your original guidance, but those two other effects are notable. Is that -- do I have those correct?\\nDave Marberger: Yes. That's correct on the $30 million, David, with the SG&A and the tax rate is actually higher because of the impacts of the sale and the impairment.\\nDavid Driscoll: Sorry, versus the estimates that were going into the quarter is what I'm getting at for how we were modeling this. But okay, fine. And then as you look forward here, the -- is there any comments that you can give us on dyssynergies? Really, Sean, your comments are so very positive, but I always wonder if when breaking these things up, isn't there just fundamentally a dyssynergy number that's got to be overcome? And would just appreciate, I know this is maybe in advance of the big Analyst Day, but is there anything you can do to help us because we've got to put numbers out today for the forward forecast and would appreciate any comments on the dyssynergy computations.\\nSean Connolly: David, the strategy that we've been undertaking to transform this portfolio, we've been at it now for a while, and we have anticipated that you will have some things that flow back against you. It's one of the reasons why we moved so aggressively on the $300 million efficiency program right out of the gate is because we wanted to stay out ahead of this stuff. Similarly, it's the same reason our supply chain team is aggressively trying to get out ahead of any absorption benefits that we might lose when we pull back on volume. So we try to look around corners. We try to anticipate it and then we try to stay ahead of it. So with respect to ConAgra Brands, sure, there will be some modest stranded as we go ahead and step through these things, but that's part of the reason why you see us getting so aggressive on costs. Lamb is a standalone company, and you'll see the details on that in the Form-10. And obviously when you set up a standalone company, you're going to incur some unique costs for doing that but obviously, we strongly believe the benefit of having Lamb as an independent pure-play company with its great performance and growth prospects is really the story there. That's a terrific equity, and we can't wait to tell investors about the story in a few weeks.\\nOperator: We'll take a question now from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.\\nRob Moskow: Sean, I was -- in your prepared remarks, you said a lot about trying to get away from the highly priced sensitive consumer by walking away from a lot of these promotional programs, and I think that makes a lot of sense. I think one of the challenges you might have at the Analyst Day is, the perception of the portfolio of ConAgra is that a lot of the brands are targeted towards price-sensitive consumers that they are value brands. In your work on those brands, have you found kind of like a segmentation within those consumers that X percent are really price-sensitive for Chef, for example, but Y percent are very loyal. And do you have any insight for us on that that could help us?\\nSean Connolly: Yes, I'll make a brief comment, Rob, and then I'll turn it over to Tom McGough to add some color. But when we're talking about these incredibly, what I'll call, price-obsessed consumers who really only buy on prices, it's not a large percentage of the user base. I mean, there is plenty -- way more brand loyal users in the user base in brands like Banquet. The issue is catering to that small group that is super price-sensitive has an unwanted effect on the balance of the business. So we've got terrific brands. And keep in mind, you've got millions and millions and millions of households out there that make $50,000 a year that need good value and -- but they are incredibly brand loyal households as well. Tom, you want to add anything to that?\\nTom McGough: Sure. What I'd add is, we will provide data that splits our volume base across loyals and switchers, and the vast majority of our consumer base are those consumers that are loyal that buy their purchases based on the strength, the benefit, the features of our products. I think what Sean highlighted is that, by focusing on incremental volume to trade promotion, we're subsidizing the purchases of those people that would normally buy us at full retail price. And our focus on trade is trying to improve the ROI on those merchandising events. So at the end of the day, we will have a stronger consumer base with a higher percentage of loyal consumers, and we will drive margin improvement through the trade productivity that we will invest in those attributes that those consumers are looking for over time.\\nOperator: Ken Goldman with JPMorgan has our next question.\\nKen Goldman: In looking at the SG&A reduction, I know you talked about how some of it was temporary. I'm trying to get a sense though of how much of the remainder of that, right, is still the majority of that reduction that's not being deferred to later in the year, we can think of as maybe permanent. So maybe could you help us break out some of the drivers of that reduction, may be roughly bucket headcount reductions versus A&P savings, things like that? And I guess, as a carload to that, in terms of the amount that was pushed out of 1Q, I think you said $25 million to $30 million, could we model all of that being in 2Q? Or should we spread that throughout the year, as we look ahead?\\nSean Connolly: First of all, Ken, I'll start, and Dave, if you want to add any color, go right ahead. The SG&A program that we've been focused on is a $200 million program, that is not an A&P program. That is a structural SG&A program. And we are, obviously, making great progress against our $200 million goal. Yes, we are tracking a bit of schedule but also some of what you are seeing, as Dave mentioned, is timing. And we're going to get into our outlook in terms of how it will flow going forward in a few weeks when we get to our Investor Day for ConAgra Brands. But the way I'd think about SG&A or for that matter, any inefficiency opportunities, we got our targets, we're making good progress on our targets, and we'll always continue to look for more pockets of inefficiency because it just gives us more fuel for growth.\\nDave Marberger: And Ken, let me call on that.\\nKen Goldman: Okay.\\nDave Marberger: Just so if you look at SG&A and you have to work through all the adjusted items, right, so if you look at the total SG&A, if you look year-on-year, we're down about $75 million for the quarter. And as I said in my remarks, about $30 million of that is really a timing that will come in, in later quarter. So that's where -- $40 million to $45 million is really the incremental kind of run rate, if you will, for the quarter for that. As you know, we started the savings in fiscal '16 really in the Q3 and 4, so Q2 will be another big incremental quarter, and then it'll start to wrap in the second half of this year where the increases will be less. But by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be 85% to 90% complete in terms of the total $200 million reduction plan.\\nKen Goldman: Okay, that's helpful, Dave. Quick follow-up, if I can. On Lamb Weston, you decided to load it up with a decent amount of leverage. Is that the natural result of wanting ConAgra Brands to have a squeaky clean balance sheet, maybe for M&A? And I'm a little confused about the decision to spin it off without a permanent CFO in place, it's a little unusual. That's not about anyone in particular, I like John, I'm just not sure how much confidence investors are going to have in whatever path is, I guess, outlined at the Analyst Day given that there is a new CFO coming in a few months later. So maybe you could help us understand the decision-making there?\\nSean Connolly: Yes. Let me try to be helpful there, Ken. With respect, first of all, to the Lamb leverage, the ConAgra Board has been squarely focused on how to maximize total value, and this is top of mind when thinking about decisions like leverage. And as you'll see at Lamb's Investor Day in a couple of weeks, it is an extremely strong business with excellent cash flows, and we are quite confident that it will continue to thrive. Beyond that, we're going to hold off until the Investor Day to get into details on things like capital priorities. With respect to the Lamb CFO, I think the big picture here that I don't want investors to lose is, we are making excellent progress rounding out the Lamb management team. You're going to learn more about these folks here in short order as well as populating the Board with seasoned veterans that are really going to help this company get off, I believe, to a flying start. We are very far along in terms of the CFO search process. I don't want to get into the details of that process or our motives publicly for obvious reasons, but with the Investor Day just a couple of weeks away, we are very fortunate to have John Gehring help us get things launched. And for those of you who weren't tracking with Ken's comments, you might have missed the -- in this morning's announcement that John will be the Interim CFO here over the course of the next couple of months, as we stand Lamb up. But again, we'll have more to talk about on our permanent CFO in the not-so-distant future.\\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bank of America's Bryan Spillane.\\nBryan Spillane: Just two quick ones for me. First, and I might have missed this, but the effective tax rate in the quarter once you've excluded all of the one-time items, just -- what's the clean sort of effective tax rate?\\nDave Marberger: The clean effective tax rate, 33.5%.\\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then the second one for you, Sean, is just -- as you're going through this process of reducing the -- your promotional activity and taking that the volume hit that comes with that, velocity starts to slow. And sometimes when velocity slows, it starts to compound on itself. So can you talk a little bit about just what you are doing? What the circuit breakers are just to make sure you don't get yourself into a situation where you've got the sort of the volume base right but it's hard to restart some velocity because of where the momentum is? And I guess, related to that, just could you confirm, it sounds like with advertising and marketing may be down in the quarter, you're still going through this process of resetting volume at a time where there's going to -- you're not really maybe necessarily fully supporting the brands with the advertising you tend to?\\nSean Connolly: All right. There's a lot there. Let me try to hit the key points there. First of all, what we're doing it's a bit like if any of you have ever remodeled a house, it's a bit like that. The process is a bit messy, but if you want to get to the desired outcome, you got to go through the process. And this is a transformation that we're undertaking here, and our approach is to value profitable growth, not any growth but we do keep a close eye on markers to make sure that the business is in control and doing what we plan. So as an example, if you get into the scanner data and you peel it back, you'll see obvious things that you should expect such as baseline trends being significantly different from promoted trends. And then furthermore, if you get into baseline velocities, you will see that our baseline velocities are, in fact, quite stable. You will see TPDs going back, but you'll see TPDs going back because we, along with being very focused on price, have infused into the marketplace over a number of years a long tail of low-margin, nonproductive SKUs of multiple sizes that we are -- frankly, they had no value, so we've to get them out. Our customers appreciate that. It's part of being good category managers. And then the key is to continue to support the items that are moving at strong velocities, contemporizing them, refreshing them and then adding to them with new innovation and then ultimately proper marketing support. Now with respect to your question of marketing support in the quarter, yes, A&P was down. Some of that is timing because we do want to align our A&P spend with planned in-market actions like innovation launches and key promotions, things like that. So some of its timing, but some of it is just good discipline and getting rid of nonworking or attempted working marketing that just, frankly, wasn't. And that is you see -- and also buying better. Your GRPs were up 7% in the quarter on a fewer dollars, so the impact was reasonably respectable. And I think it's important that we keep that kind of support out there while we're taking some of these promotion items, so we can really evolve the conversation with our consumer to be about something other than price and that's we're doing. We'll talk about this quite extensively along with things like portfolio segmentation strategy in a few weeks at our Investor Day.\\nOperator: We'll move now to Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\\nAlexia Howard: Two questions. Firstly, on the volume declines. You talked a lot about how a lot of that's deliberate given the actions that you're taken to improve the quality of revenues. Are you able to tell us if you haven't taken those actions, what the underlying volume decline would have been? And further, are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of overall volumes are associated with these consumer segments that you're really not that interested in? So volume is the first one. The second question is we're hearing from a number of places that retailers, particularly large retailers, are beginning to demand more reinvestment in price and promotional activity, which seems to be the opposite direction from where you're going. How do think that's going to play out in 2017? And are you confident that you can sort of hold your ground without losing distribution?\\nSean Connolly: Sure. Alexia, I'll take the second one first. On the notion that some retailers may be asking for more promotion, quite frankly, that tends to vary fairly meaningfully by category depending upon what a retailer's objectives are with particular categories. In general, our customers are asking us for growth and innovation. They want to see us evolve our brand so that we're not competing on price, so that we're competing on quality measures. You see customers giving more and more real state to these challenger brands that have modern food attributes like natural, organic, premium. These are the things that consumers are demanding, and this is what many of our retailers in our categories are prioritizing. And it's precisely why we're evolving the businesses that we own as well as adding new businesses that are complementarity like Frontera, Blake's and others like that. With respect to our volume piece, let's go back to the point in my prepared remarks, I think, that really describes it best. This is a -- our actions are broad-based but the volume decline, when you add it up, is incredibly concentrated. And in our case, it was in our six brands, each of which has its own story as to what we're doing and why we're doing it. But if you use Banquet as an example because that's the biggie, here's how to think about Banquet. The bottom line is locking a brand into a $1 price point for decade. It's just not a good business decision because it puts relentless pressure on margins and in turn, food quality. And at the same time, it retrains our Banquet loyalists to buy on deal. So the change was long overdue. And while the topline optics can be ugly until you wrap a year later, it's up over 300 basis points, the business and grows margin, which is excellent news. Now we've got to continue to support the business with levers other than price. And that's what we're going to do, and that's what our customers are counting on us to do.\\nOperator: We'll take a question now from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.\\nLubi Kutua: This is Lubi filling in for Akshay. First question is just on the consumer brands businesses. If you can comment on advertising expense this quarter, just trying to understand the different pieces of the -- setting the profit outperformance this quarter. So how much was -- advertising expenses were down during the quarter? And how should we think about that going forward?\\nSean Connolly: A&P was down in the quarter, as we talked. GRPs were up so impact was up, but we spent less money. We will move -- some of those dollars are moved into the remaining quarters for the balance of the year, as we talked. But it'll -- a piece of it was timing and a piece of it was just improved efficiency.\\nOperator: We'll move now to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank.\\nMario Contreras: Sean, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some good outperformance from the supply chain team in offsetting some of the over head absorption from the volume declines. Can you talk a little bit more specifically about how they're able to go about achieving that? And then related to that, how were the volume declines tracking versus your expectations going into the quarter?\\nSean Connolly: Yes. The supply chain team at ConAgra has been doing a great job for a long time. I don't know how much we've talked about the capabilities that we've had with investors, but we intend to do that in a few weeks. And we've had very strong gross productivity performance historically, and we're continuing to work to not only sustain that but to find new ways to build upon that, and we'll outline that here coming up in a few weeks for you. With respect to the volume overall, it's pretty consistent with what we expect. And if you just go back to our last couple of quarters, I've tried to be very transparent around not only our strategy, but the implications of our strategy and the notion that it's not always pretty to look at but it's important that we go through this if we're going to get to a different place. And -- but we feel like we're squarely on track.\\nOperator: We'll take a question now from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.\\nJonathan Feeney: Sean, a lot of what you've done had obviously made tremendous improvements to the value proposition. And I'm wondering, how much of -- you talked about these, your price seeking, your value only consumers, how much of this is a change in the consumers, say, over the past three or four years where maybe the strategies that were good four years ago are less relevant today? And how much of this is just you bringing a fresh set of eyes and a new methodology to the business? And I asked because maybe that -- those trends continue and it's actually maybe it's a little bit of -- it's a great time for -- I shouldn't say it's a great time, it's a much improved time for lower and middle income consumers right now with falling gas prices and wage gains. And I wonder if maybe just that improvement is helping you realize this pricing and maybe better-than-expected results?\\nSean Connolly: The way I'd think about it, John, is when the consumer looks at a brand, the brand is going to communicate something to them. For a long time, our brands communicated deal. We are a deal brand and interestingly, even low income consumers are very interested in a brand communicating with them on other means. For example, there were -- there was a period of time in our past where our PAM business was heavily promoted and the only trick in the book that we turned to was dealing. But if you look at consumer trends in oil over the last few years, you see that the oils have changed, it's moved to things like olive oil, things like coconut oil. So instead of competing on PAM on price attributes, we've evolved the PAM business, and we've got olive oil PAM. We've got coconut oil PAM. These are relevant modern-day attributes that changed the discussion with the consumer to be about something that they value and they will pay more for and not about deep discounting. That's just one example. We'll talk about more examples at our Investor Day, but that's exactly what we need to do to get really the loyalty up on our business, get our prices up and build our overall brand strength to make it as modern as it can be.\\nOperator: Our final question today will come from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.\\nMichael Walsh: It's actually Michael Walsh filling in for Todd. Sean and Dave, you've been consistent in publicly stating your desire to retain an investment grade credit rating. And earlier, you mentioned that as well. You also mentioned debt reduction, and I know ConAgra Brands will get a $675 million payment from Lamb Weston with the spin. You're going to lose a chunk of EBITDA. Can you just talk about how much debt reduction you expect going forward? And do you have any type of leverage target that you would manage your balance sheet to?\\nSean Connolly: Yes, thanks for the question. With respect to balance sheet questions, we're going to get into that in earnest in a few weeks at Investor Day. But with respect to ConAgra Brands, big picture as we've said and as you pointed out, as we intend to continue our commitment to being rated investment grade, we'll continue to a balanced capital allocation philosophy with strong dividend and a willingness to buy back shares and an appreciation for smart, value creating M&A. All of those things are fair game, which is not a departure from where we've been but rather very consistent. But we'll get into more details here on that in a few weeks.\\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Nystedt, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.\\nJohan Nystedt: Thank you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release. As always, we're available for discussions. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra.\\nOperator: This concludes today's ConAgra Foods First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day.\",\n",

      "Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Telephone & Data Systems fourth quarter operating results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jane McCahon, Vice President of Corporate Relations of TDS. Thank you. You may now begin.\n",
      "Jane McCahon: Thank you, Rob and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I want to make you all aware of the presentation we've prepared to accompany our comments this morning, which you will find on the Investor Relations section of the TDS and U.S. Cellular websites. With me today and offering prepared comments are from TDS, Doug Shuma, Senior Vice President Finance, from U.S. Cellular, Ken Meyers, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and from TDS Telecom we have Dave Wittwer, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vicki Villacrez, Vice President-Finance and CFO. This call is being simultaneously webcast on the TDS and U.S. Cellular Investor Relations websites. Please see those websites for slides referred to on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. As a reminder, we provide guidance for both operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. For TDS Telecom, these are basically the same number, but for U.S. Cellular, the adjusted EBITDA measure includes a significant contribution for partnerships which we want to continue to highlight for investors. The information set forth in the presentations and discussed during this call contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Please review the Safe Harbor paragraph in our press releases and the extended version included in our SEC filings. Shortly after we released our earnings and before the call, TDS and U.S. Cellular filed SEC Forms 8-K, including today's press releases. We planned to file our SEC Forms 10-K on Wednesday, February 24. Taking a quick look at upcoming conferences on slide three, we’ll be presenting at the Morgan Stanley conference on March 2, Deutsche Bank on March 7 and Raymond James on March 8. Please let us know if you’d like any additional information about any of these events. And do keep in mind that TDS has an open door policy. So if you’re in the Chicago area, and would like to meet members of management, the Investor Relations team will try to accommodate you calendars permitting. As it has been our tradition on our year-end call, we’d like to take a moment and recap our major accomplishments for the year just completed as well as to set forth our strategic priorities and guidance for the coming year. To begin, I’d like to turn the call over to Doug Shuma to review TDS Corporate. Doug?\n",
      "Douglas Shuma: Thanks, Jane. Turning to slide four, we continue to execute on our strategic priorities on the review of our portfolio to improve performance. During 2015, we began to reap the benefits of the significant investments we’ve been making in our businesses over the past few years. While Ken and Dave will cover these in more detail, network and IT investments at U.S. Cellular are helping them to compete more effectively and efficiently. At TDS Telecom, we’re very pleased with our fiber investments and beginning to see the contributions from our cable and HMS acquisitions. We’ve also continued to hone our portfolio, divesting ILEC properties that don’t meet our return objectives, and selling non-strategic spectrum and towers. As we think about how we allocate capital at the TDS level, we did not buy any cable assets in 2015, nor did we repurchase any TDS shares. We did however return value to our shareholders in the form of $61 million in dividends. And this morning we announced our 42 consecutive annual dividend increase. U.S. Cellular repurchased $6 million of its shares. We did make some modest repurchases of TDS shares at the beginning of 2016 under our 10b5-1 plan. We’ve also been active raising money for U.S. Cellular to fund current and future spectrum purchases, the growth in AIP and for general corporate purchases. U.S. Cellular sold $300 million of 7.25 senior notes in November 2015, and drew a $225 million bank term loan in July of 2015. Also we intend to file our shelf registration shortly after we file our 10-Ks next week to replenish the USM debt shelf back to $500 million. This is primarily an administrative step, we do not have any current plans for additional borrowings [with] [ph] U.S. Cellular. Lastly, as you are all aware, bonus depreciation was renewed late in year, resulting in approximately $65 million of cash cap savings at U.S. Cellular and approximately $95 million at consolidated TDS. And now I will turn the call over to Ken.\n",
      "Ken Meyers: Good morning. Before I start, I want to address our ability to discuss the upcoming auction for 600 megahertz spectrum known as Auction 1000. Short form applications for the forward looking portion of the auction were due on February 10, and we did file an application. As you know, this will be the most complicated spectrum auction ever conducted by the FCC. We will be watching intensely as events unfold over the next several months, including the degree to which broadcasters participate and firming up our plans accordingly. As the anti-collusion rules are now in effect, we are prohibited from speaking about it further. To be safe, we will not entertain any questions relating to any spectrum today. Now, let’s talk about 2015. Steve will cover the financial results for both the quarter and year in some detail following my comments. And I will start with some summary comments, beginning with, I’m extraordinarily proud of what the organization accomplished in 2015. Looking back at the guidance, we issued at a year ago, we met or exceeded all of our targets despite a hyper competitive marketplace and is still weaker than expected economy, especially on the consumer front. We significantly beat operating cash flow guidance, even if I adjust the original guidance for the impact of the rewards point change in the third quarter and lower than targeted customer growth for the year. Also, we completed our LTE rollout and other projects while managing CapEx to levels below our guidance. Looking at customer growth, I find it interesting that despite substantial price cutting across the industry, the switcher pool continues to decline. As we’ve said in the past, we will moderate our marketing spend based upon market conditions. Partially offsetting where I consider a short fall in gross adds is our year-over-year improvement in churn. In every quarter of 2015, churn was lower than the best quarter of 2014. Investing in our customer base is a central aspect of our strategy. I am pleased, but not yet satisfied with our results. We constantly measure customer engagement and it’s moving in the right direction, giving new reason for optimism about our ability to drive churn even lower in the future. Our customer satisfaction is clearly a result of our network strategy. In 2015, we completed our deployment of 4G LTE. It now reaches 99% of our postpaid customers, providing an excellent network experience in our suburban and rural markets. We also performed a critical testing and voiceover LTE or VoLTE, paving the way for our first commercial deployment early next year. Additionally, we signed multiple 4G LTE roaming agreements and are in the process of rolling this service out to our customers. Our device portfolio remained very strong throughout the year introducing new smartphone, tablets and other connected devices that meet the needs of our customers. We introduced new plans and services including expanded offerings of equipment installment plans which has been well received by our customers and offered competitive pricing, delivering exceptional value to our customers. At the same time we continue to improve our cost structure and manage our investments to generate significantly improved financial results. The combined impact of these achievements are a set of business results for which I am thankful and proud. Thankful for all the efforts of our team and proud to be part of the team. Now on slide seven, you can see our priorities for 2016, which I’ll expand upon in the following slides. As many will note, they’re not very different from the priorities set for 2015 and the reason is simple, these factors remain as the drivers to long-term returns. Continuing to drive subscriber growth, slide eight, remains a top priority. This is a function of increasing gross adds and managing churn. Getting new customers in the door has been the single biggest challenge over the past year. Across the industry, switching activity is down across the board. We continue to work to refine our value proposition and build awareness of both our 4G coverage and the availability of Apple and other iconic devices. It’s still very encouraging that 20% of our gross adds in the fourth quarter where previous customers coming back to us. I’d like to talk about a few other initiatives that we believe will help stimulate our gross add performance in 2016. First, we’ve intensified our focus and serving the small and medium size business customers, including local and regional government entities. This is an underpenetrated market for us and yet it is one perfect for us given our local positioning. We’ve had some initial success during 2015 and we’ll continue this push in 2016. We are also continuing to evolve our stores, [new] [ph] place to buy a phone and get service to a destination for mobile electronics. We are broadening our accessory line up and using targeted promotions to drive even more traffic into our stores. Last year, we had good results with both aspects of this retail strategy. Sales of accessories grew significantly in 2015, emergence from which help offset operating cost of the store. While targeted promotions have a success based cost structure with minimal cost, if not successful. Regardless of the depth of the switching pool in 2016, success for U.S. Cellular, both this year and into the future will be measured in large part by our ability to control an improved churn. As mentioned, the improvement in 2015 is one of our accomplishments moving from 1.8% in 2014 to 1.4% in 2015 and we finished the year, fourth quarter churn of 1.3%, and what is usually a seasonally higher quarter and yet we need to do more. While we had seen recent customer engagements course that support these results and are very encouraging. We are redoubling our efforts in 2016 and making customer engagement, a company-wide measurement for success to focus the whole organization and better meeting the needs of our customers at our midsize enrolling office. Moving to slide nine, growing our customer base is not enough. We must also capture additional revenue growth. The improvements in our smartphone portfolio and our expanded 4G network have allowed us to steadily increase postpaid smartphone penetration now at 74%. While notable progress has been made, we still have opportunity to drive additional revenue by converting more of our basic phone users, smartphone users. Our shared connect data plans are being well received by customers and allow us to capitalize and growing data consumption so long as competitive pricing doesn’t give away all of that future growth opportunity. Our third connected devices provide an opportunity to meet expanding customer needs while increasing data usage and revenue per account. At the same time, the more we meet these multiple customer needs, a more important our collective services become to customers, thereby lowering the risk of customer churn. We also see further opportunities to increase high margin revenue streams like device protection plans and accessory sales. I think it’s appropriate here to reiterate a cautionary note about the pricing environment. In 2015 we saw continued aggressing pricing movements both direct and indirect and devices as well as services demands. Our strategy is to position our authors just below our two major competitors and that knowing the access they plan for 2016, we can’t begin to protect the moves, predict the moves we may need to make to protect our base and continue to attract new subscribers. However, to somewhat mitigate that risk, we continue to work on our cost structure. Before talking about that though, I want to speak briefly regarding some regulatory developments other than the spectrum options. We expect that the FCC will likely address the issue of the future of Universal Service Funding for wireless carriers in 2016. Ted Carlson, our Chairman recently testified before the Telecommunication subcommittee of the Senate Congress committee, and I and other members of the team continued to meet with members of Congress about the importance of making ongoing funding available for continued global broadband deployment in unserved rural areas. There is still a considerable way to go to ensure citizens in rural areas can receive the benefits of 4G technology. And a challenge that 5G technology will bring are even greater. I think this message was well received by a broad spectrum of senators, members of Congress and their staffs. And we look forward to working with the FCC in 2016 on this important issue. As our guidance for 2016 implies, slide 10, we will continue to balance our need to build our customer base with the high cost of customer acquisition. We still have much to accomplish in terms of financial performances, but we made meaningful strides forward in 2015. We will continue to manage subsidies and costs across the organization with a continuing focus on reducing unit costs. With the completion of our 4G LTE network combined with our attention to free cash flow generation, we expect a meaningful decline in CapEx for the year even though we planned to upgrade our first market for VoLTE in 2016 for that early 2017 launch. In closing, our entire organization should be proud of these results. Results of their efforts in 2015 which position us well for 2016. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Steve Campbell. Steve?\n",
      "Steve Campbell: Good morning. I’ll begin with a few comments on customer results shown on slide 11 of the presentation. As Ken said earlier, we grew our customer base during the fourth quarter. Our postpaid gross additions for the fourth quarter of 2015 were 240,000 compared to 302,000 a year ago when switching activities was higher across the industry. This quarter’s gross additions increased 20% sequentially and were the highest for the year. Similar to gross additions, postpaid net additions of 68,000 were down year-over-year but they increased significantly compared to net additions achieved in the preceding three quarters which averaged about 14,000. The increase reflected the benefit of historically low churn which was 1.3% for the quarter, down from 1.6% last year. I’ll say more about postpaid churn in a minute. In the prepaid category, we had 7,000 net additions versus 2,000 net losses last year. Gross additions were up about 15% and churn improved to 5.4% this quarter versus 5.9% a year ago. The device mix of our postpaid gross and net additions in the fourth quarter is shown at the bottom of the chart. Similar to the past few quarters, the postpaid additions were primarily data centric devices like smartphones and connected devices, especially tablets. This quarter smartphones represented 55% of total gross additions. Connected devices represented 41% of postpaid gross additions and translated into 70,000 additions. The next slide has a chart showing the trend in our postpaid churn rate over the past nine quarters. Churn peaked at 2.29% in the first quarter of 2014 and has continued on a steady downward trend since that time decreasing to 1.31% for the fourth quarter of 2015. As stated earlier, our recent gross additions have consisted primarily of data centric devices with smartphones being the largest component. Slide 13 of the presentation shows the positive trends in smartphone sales and penetration. During the fourth quarter we sold 515,000 smartphones which represented 91% of total handsets sold, driving our smartphone penetration to 74% of the base of postpaid handset customers up from 65% a year ago. And during the fourth quarter we also sold 95,000 connected devices. At the end of the fourth quarter, we still had 26% of our postpaid customers with feature phones. Obviously this represents an opportunity to upgrade these customers to smartphones and drive additional data usage revenues and we planned to continue targeted offers to these customers in the current year. As Ken said earlier, along with the higher penetration for smartphones and connective devices, we’re also seeing more customers about our shared, connected data plans. The penetration on these plans is now 78%, up from just 46% a year ago. Getting more customers on data centric devices and shared data plans is critical to our strategy as monetizing the growth in data usage. The next slide illustrates just how much that data usage has continued to grow over the past seven quarters, in terms of total system usage and on a per subscriber basis. I should point out that the average usage per subscriber shown here reflects all data subscribers, including those with connective devices. For smartphone users only, the average usage increased 12% totaling 18,045 megabytes this quarter versus 16,050 megabytes a year ago. So now let’s talk about revenues. Postpaid ARPU as reported was $51.46 for the fourth quarter, down 9% year-over-year. However, as we know there are lot of factors that affect ARPU, some positive like significant growth in data usage that I just highlighted and some negative like industry price competition. Further with the introduction of equipment installment plans, we’ve seen a shift between service plan revenue and equipment revenue. When we adjust for that shift by combining reported service plan revenue and equipment installment plan billings, average billings per user which represent the total amount being collected from customers every month, decreased by less than 1% year-over-year, despite the growth in connective devices which have considerably lower revenue per device. These impacts are better seen looking at postpaid average revenue per account. ARPA as reported was $131.96, down 3% year-over-year. But when we consider the equipment installment plan billings, average billings per user actually increased by about 5% year-over-year. Total operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $987 million, down 2% from a year ago. Within that, total service revenues were $802 million, down $48 million or 6% from last year, largely reflecting lower plan pricing due to industry competition as well as the planned discounts that accompany equipment installment sales and activations of customer-owned equipment. The other significant item contributing to the reduction in service revenues was roaming revenue which declined by $7 million or 13% primarily due to lower rates for data usage. Note, however, that we also realized a benefit from lower rates on our outbound data roaming traffic. Total expense for outbound roaming decreased by about 5% year-over-year with the impact of lower rates more than offsetting a significant increase in data usage. ETC revenues, included in the other category on this slide, were flat year-over-year at $23 million as the FCC's phase down of Universal Service Fund support remains suspended. Equipment sales revenues grew 16% to $185 million driven by higher equipment installment plan sales. Our overall financial performance for the quarter was quite strong as Ken said and as shown further on slide 17. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $137 million nearly double $69 million a year ago. Lower costs and expenses in all major categories. System operations, equipment, and SG&A expenses contributed to the overall improvement. Total cash expenses of $850 million decreased by $89 million or 10% year-over-year. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, operating income excluding the gains and losses in both periods improved significantly year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA shown next incorporates the earnings from our equity method partnerships along with interest and dividend income, which consists mainly of imputed interest income from equipment installment plans. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $178 million up 80% from $99 million last year, driven largely by the increase in operating cash flow. Earnings from unconsolidated entities were $30 million. This included $16 million from the Los Angeles partnership, up about $2 million year-over-year. As we expected and disclosed previously, we did not receive any cash distributions from the LA partnership in 2015. A summary of full-year results for some of our key financial measures is shown on slide 19. These are the as reported figures which include the impact of the termination of the rewards program. Total operating revenues were nearly $4 billion, up 3% from the prior year. Operating cash flow was $675 million, up 100% or double last year's number. We also achieved dramatic improvement in operating income, excluding the gains and losses in both periods, $69 million of income this year compared to a loss of $268 million last year. And adjusted EBITDA was $852 million, up 77% from $480 million a year-ago. Next, I want to cover our guidance for 2016. As we've discussed already, 2015 actual results were significantly better than the updated guidance we provided this year for all metrics other than revenues. This stronger 2015 performance, our 2016 goal of growing our business and the prospect for continued price-based competition in the market all combined to produce guidance that is similar to our strong performance in 2015 and actually lines up pretty well with most 2016 analyst estimates. Our estimates for full year 2016 are shown on slide 20 of the presentation. For comparison, we're showing our 2015 results both as reported and excluding the impact of the termination of the rewards program. For total operating revenues, we expect a range of approximately $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. This reflects our expectation for modest customer growth along with additional demand for equipment installment plans and data monetization, offset to some degree by the competitive pricing environment. For operating cash flow, we expect a range of $525 million to $650 million and the estimate for operating cash flow flows through to the estimated range for adjusted EBITDA which is $725 million to $850 million. These estimates reflect the higher operating revenues offset by higher expected customer acquisition cost. This in turn offset to some degree by continued cost control initiatives. To the extent that we achieved a lower level of customer growth than currently estimated, we would expect results to be in the upper portion of these ranges. On the other hand, to the extent that we are successful in attracting a higher level of customer growth than currently estimated or if the pricing environment worsens, we would expect results to be in the lower portion of the ranges. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $500 million. This lower level of spending compared to 2015 reflects the completion of our 4G LTE deployment yet includes spending to meet higher data demand and to prepare for the initial commercial launch of VoLTE. Finally, I want to make just a couple of comments about U.S. Cellular's cash position and liquidity. As of December 31, cash and equivalents totaled $750 million. In addition to these existing balances, U.S. Cellular has $282 million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. We believe that these sources of cash together with expected cash flows from operating and investing activities provide sufficient resources to meet our normal operating needs and debt service requirements for the coming year. However, these resources may not be adequate to fund all future expenditures that we could have potentially elect to make such as purchases of spectrum licenses and FCC auctions or other acquisitions. It may be necessary from time-to-time to increase the size of the existing revolving credit facility to issue new debt or to obtain other forms of financing in order to fund these potential expenditures. As of December 31, accounts receivable under equipment installment plans totaled $354 million. These receivables represent another potential source of financing if its needed. And now, I'll turn the call over to Dave Wittwer to discuss TDS Telecom. Dave?\n",
      "Dave Wittwer: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share our 2015 accomplishments, and then I'll outline our strategic priorities for 2016. We continue to see cables, a natural extension of our wireline business. The common strategy for this business is to own the best pipe in the market and use that advantage to grow high-margin broadband services bundled with video and voice products. To achieve this objective, we are continuing the integration of our cable and wireline businesses in order to take advantage of product, operational and infrastructure synergies. On slide 22, in our Wireline business, we have continued our focus on providing the most competitive broadband service and related products which has led the growth in both broadband and IPTV connections. Where economically feasible, fiber technology is being deployed to provide Internet speeds up to 1 gigabit per second. By the end of 2015, we had deployed fiber-to-the-home to 21% of our ILEC service addresses. Our IPTV product called TDS TV is an important offering that leverages our high-speed network, improves our ARPU, and reduces churns through attractive bundling. In 2015, we continued rolling our IPTV to the markets. We have now launched TDS TV in 27 markets, enabling 167,000 service addresses, which is roughly 23% of our total footprint. IPTV penetration increased due to strong sales and newly launched fiber markets which utilize the fiber billed presale strategy and the rollout of a bundled product in the IPTV cover markets. We are very pleased with the success of our IPTV deployments, and we'll continue to make investments here in both fiber and copper plant to drive further penetration of IPTV. One positive side effect of the increased triple-play bundle is that it has moderated the losses of legacy voice lines. In our cable business, our investment thesis is around monetizing the growing demand for high-quality broadband services. To execute on this strategy, we have made investments to increase capacity on the broadband network. And we have rolled out new products to improve the customer experience. We also rebranded our Baja cable markets as TDS. For both current and prospective customers, our recent improvements in the networks and product offerings in these markets will positively influence their choice of TDS. For our Hosted and Managed Service businesses, we continue to execute the vision we have for profitably serving the IT outsourcing needs of midmarket customers. In 2015, we saw a stronger revenue growth for the year driven by equipment sales and professional services offerings. While recurring service revenue growth is still below our expectations, we remain focused on improving our sales performance. Looking ahead to 2016, slide 23, our strategic priorities remain unchanged. For the Wireline and Cable segments, that means continuing to focus on owning the best pipe in the market. Depending primarily on market density, we want to have the most competitive broadband offerings. This supports our Wireline fiber strategy and in cable, it is one of our key acquisition criteria. Also in 2016, we want our HMS segment to continue to execute the vision we have for profitably serving the IT outsourcing needs of mid-market customers. In the Wireline business, we will continue to deploy fiber where it strategically and economically makes sense and where our cost and demographic metrics support the business case. In 2016, we are completing our planned fiber builds to reach approximately 25% of our ILEC service addresses, and we'll focus on driving further penetration of triple-play bundles in our existing markets. The completion of the planned fiber deployments is driving the lower capital spending for the Wireline segment in 2016. To further strengthen our broadband offerings, we will also deploy bonding technology to derive higher speeds in certain ILEC capital markets. Other elements for our strategy include our continued focus on providing exceptional customer service, being influential on regulatory reform issues and managing our costs. With regards to our regulatory efforts, TDS Telecom has been very involved, both independently and with national trade associations, to communicate our positions on the need for additional funding to further broadband expansion in rural areas. We have been meeting with the FCC to express our support for the adoption of a voluntary and model-based plan as well as other reforms to the current rate of return mechanisms. While we are optimistic these changes will provide additional funding to help us improve our broadband delivery in certain markets, much can still change and we will keep you updated. For Cable, we expect to continue growing customer penetration levels by offering existing wireline products and services in our cable markets and leveraging talent, knowledge, systems and network infrastructure across the two business. To support our strategy of growing broadband penetration, we will roll out speeds up to 300 megabits per second in our most competitive cable markets throughout the year. Also, an important cable initiative for us in 2016 is analog reclamation. This project will transition our analog and cable markets to all digital and the main benefits are improved customer experience and reclaim spectrum to provide higher broadband speeds. In addition to focusing on our existing cable markets, we also have been evaluating acquisition opportunities in the cable space. Although we did not make any cable acquisitions in 2015, we will continue to pursue cable acquisitions that have favorable competitive environment, attractive market demographics, and the ability to grow broadband penetration. We are disciplined buyers and we'll only do a deal if we can make it work. For our HMS operations in 2016, we are very focused on continuing to develop our hybrid cloud strategy of selling solutions tailored to customer needs to drive service revenue growth. On the cost side of our business, we are committed to further optimizing our operations to improve profitability. We are confident that we have identified a very attractive market opportunity and our committed to the mid-market strategy we are pursuing. At TDS Telecom, we are very proud of the progress we have made, building and integrating the growth businesses that will enable to be successful and improve returns over time. I'll now turn this call over to Vicki Villacrez to talk about the fourth quarter results.\n",
      "Vicki Villacrez: Okay. Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by making a few comments on our consolidated results starting on slide 24. First, on the Wireline side, IPTV and broadband services are helping to replace the continuing declines in wholesale and commercial revenue. Second, Cable operations remain flat year-over-year. There are no acquisition impacts this quarter. And third, HMS had another quarter showing meaningful improvement. Total revenues increased 14% due to both higher equipment sales and service revenues. Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis declined 8% year-over-year to $71 million. Consistent with past quarters and as expected, Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased as wholesale and commercial revenues continued to decline and benefits from cost reductions slowed. Contributions from HMS partially offset this decline. Looking at Wireline results on slide 25. Residential revenues were impacted by ILEC divestitures and one-time adjustments, which caused the decline of 1%. Without those adjustments, residential revenues would have increased 4% as growth in broadband and IPTV more than offset the decline in legacy voice services. The year-over-year decrease in ILEC residential voice connections has held at about 3% over the past six quarters excluding divestitures. Commercial revenues decreased 4% as declines from legacy voice and broadband connections were greater than the growth in managed IP connections. Wholesale revenues decreased this quarter in line with our expectations. On a combined basis, total Wireline revenues declined 4% to $174 million. Wireline cash expenses increased 2% as increases in employee-related expenses and IPTV content costs outpaced the reduced cost of provisioning legacy services. As a result, adjusted EBITDA decreased $8 million or 13%. Slide 26. Looking at residential broadband, customers are continuing to choose higher speeds in our ILEC market, with 47% choosing speeds of 10 megabits or greater and 16% choosing speeds of 25 megabits or greater, driving increases in average revenue per connection to $43.15, excluding the impacts of this quarter's onetime item. In the quarter, we launched five additional IPTV markets bringing our total up to 27. The uptake in IPTV is encouraging at an average penetration rate of 26%. IPTV connections grew 47%, adding 11,000 subscribers compared to the prior year. We are offering a variety of speeds up 1-gig service in all IPTV markets. These actions are driving 98% of our IPTV customers to take all three services, which results in a low churn rate. On the right side of the slide, you can see that we increased connections from our commercial voice and data communications solutions managed IP 5% year-over-year. Turning to slide 27, our Cable segment is comparable year-over-year as there are no acquisition impacts. Total cable connections grew to 280,000. Total residential connections grew 6% as growth in broadband and voice were partially offset by decline in video connection. Total cable revenues were $43 million, which is flat year-over-year, driven by an increase in residential connections, offset by lower ARPU due to promotional offerings and the one-time adjustment. Without the adjustment, revenues would have increased 2%. Cash expenses were relatively flat as higher programming content costs were offset by synergies and cost reductions in other areas. As a result, cable adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat. Now, turning to the HMS segment on slide 28. We had another quarter of improvement. HMS operating revenues increased $8 million or 14% year-over-year on equipment sales as well as improved service growth of 6%, which includes 4% growth in our recurring service revenues, which are comprised of collocation hosted management cloud services. Cash expenses were also up 10% compared to the same period in the prior year, which reflects higher cost of goods sold and cost of services needed to support the revenue growth. Due to efficiency improvement, other operating expenses were down. HMS generated adjusted EBITDA improvement of $2 million which is beginning to show evidence of our efforts to integrate in streamline operations of our five acquisitions. Since this is a year-end, let me briefly highlight our results for the full year on slide 29. We are pleased with 2015 performance overall. In total, we ended the year with revenues of $1.16 billion up 6% from prior year and in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $306 million was up $8 million or 3% from 2014, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Capital expenditures were $219 million on top of guidance. These results are reference point for our 2016 guidance which I will walk you through on slide 30. We are forecasting revenues of $1.13 billion to $1.18 billion. For revenue – for Wireline, we anticipate continued decline in legacy voice, commercial and wholesale revenues to more than offset the expected consumer growth in IPTV and broadband. Losses from wholesale revenues are slowing but are still meaningful at approximately $10 million. We expect Cable revenue growth in the mid-single digits and HMS recurring service revenue growth also in the mid-single digit. Adjusted EBITDA is forecast to be within the range of $270 million to $310 million. Contributions from cable and HMS operations will help offset the pressures in the wireline segment. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $180 million in 2016. Within the segments, Wireline CapEx which is about two-thirds of total spend is expected to decrease as we complete our planned fiber spending and targeted wireline markets. The Cable capital budget includes funds for success-based growth including the one-time analog reclamation project and increased broadband speed. HMS CapEx is lower than last year reflecting completion of our planned data center build out and has primarily success-based capital. We've been investing heavily in all of our businesses to improve our competitive position in the market we serve and to capitalize on the demand for higher speed broadband services and IT outsourcing needs. With our initial plan, fiber deployments nearing their end and our current data center build to complete. We now look to lower capital intensity, which will drive higher levels of free cash flow and important metric to drive our future financial returns. I will now turn the call back to Jane.\n",
      "Jane McCahon: Thanks, Vicki and operator, we're ready for questions.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please while poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Ken Meyers: Hello, Phil.\n",
      "Jane McCahon: Phil, you might want to take your phone off mute.\n",
      "Forrest Wilson: Hey, guys. Sorry. It's Forrest Wilson in for Phil Cusick. I was just curious about your plans for growing gross adds going forward. How do you plan to differentiate yourself from the national carriers and attract switchers going forward? Thanks.\n",
      "Ken Meyers: So as I think I said, Forrest in the comments a lot - we're doing a lot of things. One is continuing to focus on those mid-sized and smaller businesses in our markets where – because of where our position and the service that we can offer. I think we can differentiate there. And that leads to their employee base, number one. Number two, continuing to evolve how we look at our stores as retail destination spots driving more traffic into them with retailing-type activities. Those are two of the larger efforts this year that are a little bit different than the approach we've taken so far. And given the progress that we've seen in churn, it does – we're right on the cusp of where small changes in gross adds make meaningful difference in customer growth.\n",
      "Forrest Wilson: Okay. Thanks. And if I could ask just one more. You mentioned a longer upgrade cycle. Can you kind of elaborate on that? I mean, do you think that – is that a secular issue, or is it just a question of iPhone timing? Thanks.\n",
      "Ken Meyers: No. I think it's – from what we've seen so far, and I'd have to be – I'm the first to tell you, we are younger in the curve than others. And so, we're starting to see it in other places more than we're seeing it here. But we've got a large part of our customer base simply holding on to their phone longer. So, even if they are out of what I would call the contract period, other things that – just given the pure price of the phone, you are seeing terms for the equipment installment plan elongating in order to help offset or manage that monthly cost of the phone because these phones – some of these phones are now across – in the $700 barrier. That's a pretty-substantial item for our family when you start adding two and three and four lines to them. So, I'm not surprised by it, but I am not yet in a position to say, where does it kind of bottom up.\n",
      "Jane McCahon: Next question, please?\n",
      "Operator: Yes. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Jane McCahon: Hey, Ric.\n",
      "Ric Prentiss: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\n",
      "Ken Meyers: Hey. Good morning.\n",
      "Ric Prentiss: I want to ask one question but multi parts as always. First, to clear up some confusion that seems to come out in the marketplace today, your fourth quarter EBITDA of $178 million, we were looking for $103 million. I think consensus was about $105 million. And on 2016 guidance, your $725 million to $850 million suggests a midpoint around $788 million, and we were looking for $758 million, and consensus I think is $750 million. So, first question is just, can you confirm that those are decent consensus numbers for what, 4Q and 2016 guidance are compared to what you just gave?\n",
      "Jane McCahon: Yes, Ric. Those are exactly our numbers.\n",
      "Ric Prentiss: Okay. Then the second part of the question, it is – and I think, Ken, you alluded to it, the guidance does assume that there is a focus on growing the business and you talked about the gross adds on the last question here. Can you get us a little color on when you said the upper portion, if there is slower growth, the lower portion, if there's better growth, last year, when you think about your guidance, you continually updated the guidance throughout the year pretty meaningfully. Initial EBITDA, $580 million to $630 million to $650 million to $750 million, and you almost hit $800 million when you adjust out the rewards program. Just trying to gauge how much do you think you've baked into the range which is fairly tight for what’s a surprise on the upside to a surprise on the downside for subscriber adds?\n",
      "Ken Meyers: You said multiple parts. You didn't tell me they'll be complicated, too. Clearly, this year, growth was lower than we had targeted, and we took that into account account in looking at our guidance for this year. There isn't anything baked into our plans that says, boy, suddenly, we go back four years in terms of growth and we're topping out a 1.1 million, 1.2 million gross adds. That isn't what it's baked, not at all, but there is a range that is particularly pronounced when you have this success-based promotions because if you don't get the gross add, that's a whole [indiscernible] cost that isn't incurred and flows right to the bottom line. So, we try to be real reasonable in our targets for growth or assumptions or what we will be able to drive for the year. I think the word Steve used for [indiscernible] was we were looking for modest growth, okay. But if our target is to grow, so all our numbers are based upon achieving the goal, and if we do, we'll spend some more dollars in marketing that are in plans that are designed to be profitable. We aren't trying to just add numbers to add numbers. But if those –the switcher pool stays as shallow as it has recently been then you aren't going to see those incremental marketing spends and they're going to fall back to the bottom line.\n",
      "Ric Prentiss: That makes sense. And then the third part of the question, [indiscernible] so I apologize, but there's a lot of moving pieces. The EIP plans are an important part of the market these days. Can you update us as far as what you saw as far as take rates for EIP in the fourth quarter? What you're expecting that should look like in 2016 guidance because it does move money around from service to equipment and the accounting and the interest income?\n",
      "Ken Meyers: Yeah. Boy, a couple of things there too. So, last year EIP was, actually, had a smaller take rate than we had seen in other carriers throughout the year. And part of that is our own marketing strategy which is, we wanted to have the rate plans and the products and services that meet the needs of our customers. So, therefore, we will continue, with both subsidized and EIP plans, with each set of plans designed to meet the needs of those customer groups and to be profitable for us. It's not a matter of us trying to push one plan versus the other. Having said that, last year, Q4 up 45% of our activations were on EIP. That was higher than prior quarters and reflected kind of the first time that our agents channel had full access to EIP plans. Now, so we saw a little bit of improvement in the holiday in that product a little higher take rate so it just got an improvement. But a higher take rate in that – with that plan. Now, starting off this year, interestingly, we're seeing a significant step-up in the take rate of EIP. I don't have enough insight into why. There isn't anything that's dramatically different about the construct of our plans or anything else. And in the first time kind of through it, I don't know whether that's a seasonal impact, in the past we always talked about a prepaid market in the first couple of months of the year. And people got their income tax returns. I don't know if this is related to that, but right now, we are running significantly higher than the 45% we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.\n",
      "Ric Prentiss: Well, okay. That helps a lot. And appreciate again clearing up the confusion on what your numbers were versus consensus. Thanks.\n",
      "Ken Meyers: Thanks, Ric.\n",
      "Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sergey Dluzhevskiy with Gabelli. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Jane McCahon: Hi, Sergey.\n",
      "Sergey Dluzhevskiy: Good morning, guys. Hi.\n",
      "Ken Meyers: Good morning.\n",
      "Sergey Dluzhevskiy: A couple of questions. So, first one I think for Doug. So, you didn't repurchase any shares in the first quarter, but I think you mentioned that you did purchase some in the beginning of this year. Could you disclose in shares or in dollars what was the amount of the repurchase?\n",
      "Douglas Shuma: Yeah. It's modest, Sergey. We're not out in the market buying hundreds of millions of dollars of shares. But I've mentioned that just because we obviously were out of the market entirely last year, and we did make share repurchases this year, so...\n",
      "Sergey Dluzhevskiy: Okay. Is it going to be disclosed in the 10-K or do we just need to wait until 2016?\n",
      "Douglas Shuma: More or less 2016 items. So, you'll see them.\n",
      "Sergey Dluzhevskiy: Sure. Okay. In terms of – the second question is for Ken and Steve. So, you guys talked obviously about different puts and takes in respect to EBITDA for 2016, and I think your longer-term target is to get the EBITDA margins somewhere in 20%, 25% range. So, given the growing competitive environment, do we see a path for those margins? I guess, if the environment doesn't change, what else could you guys do to improve margins over time?\n",
      "Ken Meyers: Sergey, given the pricing environment that we're sitting in right now to talk about a path beyond what we've talked about in 2016 is purely speculative – more speculative than I want to stick my neck out on. I mean, right now, we continue to focus on how really improving all aspects of the business performance, whether it be our investment levels in the network and really getting much sharper in there to our cost structure to improving the effectiveness of our scores. So, our target still is mid-25. Mid-25s. Mid-20s in terms of making some of the returns work out the way I think they need to work out. But right now, the focus is on just the competitive position in 2016.\n",
      "Sergey Dluzhevskiy: Okay. And my last question is for Dave and Vicki. So, in regards to some of the regulatory dynamics on the ILEC front, particularly, as they relate to rate of return carriers. So, you briefly mentioned this in your prepared comments, but I was just wondering. What your general thoughts are on ACAM, what are your basic expectations as far as was that mechanism and also the timing of this process?\n",
      "Vicki Villacrez: Sure, Sergey. This is Vicki. Overall, as I gave guidance for the year, in our regulatory impact, we do expect wholesale and regulatory declines of approximately $8 million to $10 million in 2016. With respect to the CAF 2 reform and the impact on the rate of return carriers, we are optimistic on what we believe is the current framework for the FCC's reform efforts. Our teams have been involved both independently and with the National Trade Associations. And we've met with five commissioner offices at the FCC advocating our position, which is to ensure that we will receive or there will be additional funding to help us improve our broadband delivery in the most rural areas in our footprint. So, I can't say what that change is going to look like yet until we see the details of the order but our guidance does not include any impacts that could result from the FCC's decision. And it may require some upfront level of capital spending in 2016. We'll let you know more.\n",
      "Sergey Dluzhevskiy: And what are your expectations on the timing of the order and some of the ...\n",
      "Vicki Villacrez: We expect that very soon.\n",
      "Sergey Dluzhevskiy: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\n",
      "Jane McCahon: Operator, we have time for one more question.\n",
      "Operator: Yes. That question is coming from the line of Barry Sine with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
      "Barry Sine: Hey. Good morning, folks. And I might sneak in more than one, if you don't mind. First question, I guess, Sunday, Samsung is coming out with the new S7 reportedly. I know, historically, you've had a heavier penetration of Samsung devices. Could you update us? Is that still the case? Have iPhones caught up? And is there anything in particular that you'd be looking at with this refresh cycle that might be impacting your term results?\n",
      "Ken Meyers: We continue to see nice growth in the Apple product. It's running just under 40% of our kind of handsets. But Samsung is our number one, it has been our number one. I intend to be there Sunday when they roll out that new product and I'm looking forward with great excitement to see what they're doing next.\n",
      "Barry Sine: And any impact that may have on – what typically impact does that have when Samsung comes out with the new device in your quarterly results?\n",
      "Ken Meyers: They are on a cycle where about the first quarter of each year is when they – when they get launched, end of first quarter, beginning of second quarter, their timing is the same this year. So, I don't think – I'm not expecting to see a significant year-over-year change because of that result – that launch.\n",
      "Barry Sine: Okay.\n",
      "Ken Meyers: I'm hopeful but not expecting.\n",
      "Barry Sine: Next question. In terms of wireless competition, you had a number of comments on that. Can you give any sense of what you're seeing in terms of port-ins, port-outs? You talked about winning back some customers. Who are your winning customers from and what part of your service offering is attractive, is it price, is it network quality?\n",
      "Ken Meyers: The port-in studies are always amazing. What you will see is that we win from and lose to whoever our biggest largest market share competitor is in our market. We do not see substantial changes where market share is being taken suddenly by new entrant or anything like that. When we look at the reasons, the reasons that we win customers turn out to be number one, network quality. And the reason that we lose them, number one, is network quality, which makes you wonder the value of the research that you spend so much time and energy getting. But it's their quality and price one and two typically on the coming and going out.\n",
      "Barry Sine: Okay. My last question more on the TDS telecom side around M&A. Just wanted to get an update in your sense of what you'd be looking for doing in 2016. Sounds like you're still interested in cable. HMS with only $1 million in EBITDA in the quarter. It sounds like you'd still be on hold waiting for results to perk up a little bit there. And Telco, are there any live prospects to divest additional small ILEC properties over the near term?\n",
      "Vicki Villacrez: I think it's fair to – we don't comment on any pending transactions. We're obviously focused on finding ways to grow the business. As we said, we did not have a cable acquisition in 2015, but we continued to be opportunistic. We're looking for all kinds of different options or ways to go the business including cable acquisitions, things that could help complement our Hosted and Managed Services, there's certainly options. And I think you're going to see is we made some very small divestitures of our ILEC markets. Those two could be opportunistic, but there's not a wholesale plan in place.\n",
      "Barry Sine: Okay. Thank you very much.\n",
      "Jane McCahon: Thank you, folks, for your time this morning, and we'll be in touch doing follow-up calls. Let me know if you have further questions. Thanks so much.\n",
      "Operator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.\n"

      "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Peabody Energy Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. For the conference, all the participant lines will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Vic Svec, Senior Vice President, Global Investor and Corporate Communications.\n",
      "Victor P. Svec - SVP-Global Investor & Corporate Relations: Good morning, and thanks for taking part in the conference call for BTU. With us today, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Kellow; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Amy Schwetz. We do have some forward-looking statements today and I would remind you that they should be considered, along with the risk factors that we note, at the end of our release, as well as the MD&A section of our filed documents. And we also refer you to peabodyenergy.com for additional information. Also please note that, given ongoing activities regarding our financial objectives, Peabody will not be conducting a Q&A session following our formal remarks. Should you have follow-up questions unrelated to these activities, please contact Peabody Investor Relations at, ir@peabodyenergy.com, following our call. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Amy.\n",
      "Amy B. Schwetz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Vic, and good morning, everyone. In 2015, unprecedented commodity and coal market issues heavily weighed on our performance. At the same time, the Peabody team improved safety and substantially lowered costs and capital. We are also pursuing aggressive actions to preserve liquidity and delever our balance sheet. I'll start by discussing the 2015 results, then review our liquidity position, and conclude with an update of our 2016 guidance. Let's begin with a review of the income statement. 2015 revenues of $5.6 billion declined 17%, impacted by lower realized pricing in both the U.S. and Australia as well as an 8% reduction in sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $435 million in 2015 compared to $814 million in the prior year. The team was able to claw back some $620 million through lower costs in both the U.S. and Australia. However, that was unable to offset over $450 million in lower pricing and $387 million in additional realized hedge losses. In the fourth quarter, Peabody took a $377 million impairment charge. As you may recall that earlier in the year we took $900 million in charges, bringing the total impairment for the year to $1.28 billion, primarily related to lower coal prices. Specific to the fourth quarter charge, $251 million related to the Australian Metallurgical Mining operations and $126 million related to our reserve position in the Midwest. Interest expense was $533 million in 2015, and includes nearly $68 million of early extinguishment losses from refinancing of our 2016 Senior Notes in the first half of the year. Continuing down the income statement, full-year taxes reflect a benefit of $135 million compared to prior-year expense of $201 million. The $336 million improvement is driven by a $75 million benefit related to asset impairments and a valuation allowance of nearly $285 million recorded against U.S. income taxes in 2014. Loss from continuing operations totaled $1.85 billion, including $1.2 billion from asset impairments, net of income taxes. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations totaled nearly $103 and adjusted diluted loss per share totaled $36.39. I'll remind you that both those numbers have been adjusted for the 1-for-15 reverse stock split that took place in October. Discontinued operations reflect a loss of $182 million for the year. As you'll recall from last quarter, this is primarily due to the third quarter charge we recorded for certain Patriot liability. I'd like to now briefly touch on the fourth quarter results. Adjusted EBITDA of $53 million reflects several changes from the third quarter. Trading results declined $33 million from the segment's strong third quarter operating performance. As we noted on the call in October, we expected Trading results to return to normalized levels. U.S. Mining operations fell $22 million primarily as a result of lower volumes in the Midwest and the West. Australian Mining operations declined $10 million primarily due to lower pricing. While within our guidance range, SG&A increased $10 million largely due to professional fees for a number of business development and financing transactions, both completed and contemplated. And finally, other operating costs increased $18 million due primarily to $14 million charge associated with Peabody assigning a portion of our Australian port capacity to another producer. Partially offsetting these impacts, Peabody had additional gains of $17 (sic) [$70] million related to ongoing activities as we continue to sell surplus land and reserves. Now let's turn to the supplemental information for the full year. U.S. Mining adjusted EBITDA decreased $146 million in 2015, reflecting sharply lower volumes across the platform, with shipments down 25% in the West and 15% in the Midwest. Even with reduced volumes, costs per ton improved 5%, driven by a higher PRB mix, lower fuel pricing, and continued focus on cost improvements. In the PRB, subdued natural gas prices and higher customer stockpiles drove a nearly 4 million ton reduction in volume from our expectations, with a significant portion of that coming very late in the quarter. Given that we were fully committed in 2015, many of these reductions were deferred into later periods. In the Midwest, gross margins rose 3% even with lower volumes as favorable fuel pricing and other measures resulted in more than a $2 per ton improvement in costs. Western shipments declined 6 million tons in 2015 with nearly half of the decrease due to a planned reduction in exports and the remainder due to lower customer deliveries from weak natural gas prices. The higher fixed cost allocation resulted in 4% higher unit cost. Turning to Australia, 2015 adjusted EBITDA increased $62 million to $175 million, an impressive feat in face of lower volumes and a $420 million impact from lower pricing. Favorable currency and fuel costs combined with productivity improvements to overcome the challenging market conditions. Metallurgical coal volumes declined 1.5 million tons, primarily due to production cuts announced during the second quarter, a planned reduction at the contractor-operated Burton Mine, and the closure of the Eaglefield Mine in late 2014. Despite reduced shipments and lower realized pricing, gross margins improved as a result of $26 decline in unit costs. The operations had $115 million in cost improvement, independent of currency and fuel. This performance came despite $40 million of negative adjusted EBITDA at the contractor-operated Burton Mine. You will recall that we resectored this long-term contract for greater flexibility in 2014, and we expect to place the mine in care and maintenance mode during the end of 2016. The Thermal segment also continues to benefit from the declining Australian dollar and lower fuel costs. However, these savings were not enough to offset $9 per ton in lower pricing and shipments. Full-year Trading and Brokerage adjusted EBITDA increased $12 million to $27 million, despite a 5 million ton volume reduction. Results included favorable positions settled during the year, and a $7 million gain related to a negotiated settlement in the third quarter. Realized corporate hedge losses, primarily driven by currency, totaled $437 million for the year. These positions continue to roll off as we do not have any currency or fuel hedges past 2017. Consistent with prior quarters, we have included a summary of our hedge position in the supplemental schedule, highlighting our lower fuel and currency requirements, and all-in forward rates. It has not gone unnoticed by the new team that our adjusted EBITDA would have offset the impact of lower pricing and, in fact, would have been higher than 2014, if not for the increased hedging losses. With that review of the income statement and earnings drivers, let's turn to our liquidity position. Peabody ended the year with $1.2 billion of liquidity, and about $710 million in letters of credit. In 2015, our liquidity was impacted by providing credit support to financial institutions, nearly $400 million in cash interest payments, $277 million in PRB reserve installments, lower cash from operations, and a $75 million VEBA payment. Recently, the company accessed the remaining capacity under its revolving credit facility to provide Peabody with the maximum amount of control and flexibility with respect to its liquidity positions in light of continued challenging market conditions. As of February 9, 2016, liquidity totaled about $900 million consisting nearly all of cash. The company also had approximately $825 million in letters of credit issued primarily off our revolver, supporting surety bonds, bank guarantees, and other obligations. We had approximately $514 million of surety bonds outstanding, for which we have posted $160 million of letters of credit or 30% of the total amount. I will note that while we have had discussions with our providers, the amount of collateral under these bilateral agreements can change. We had approximately $390 million of bank guarantees outstanding and have collateralized over 95% of these obligations. And we had approximately $290 million in letters of credit for other obligations, such as port agreements and pension, most of which have been in place for some time. We are focused on preserving liquidity and reducing debt, which remain our top financial priorities in 2016. I would also add that, in the fourth quarter, Peabody self-bonding was affirmed for our North Antelope Rochelle and Rawhide Mines in the PRB. Looking forward, Peabody has several cash obligations that expire or materially decline in the next two years. First, we are scheduled to complete the last committed annual PRB reserve installment of $250 million late this year, which provides us with a competitive advantage in the region. As you may recall, we were awarded these leases in late 2012 following a competitive bidding auction. Second, we continue to see a benefit in hedge realizations each quarter as the year progresses, and at current rates, realized 2016 hedge losses would be approximately $100 million lower than 2015 and even lower in 2017. Third, our recently announced amended agreement with the UMWA regarding the VEBA trust fund improves 2017 cash flows by $70 million. And finally, we proactively assigned excess Australian port capacity to another producer, which is expected to reduce infrastructure costs by more than $60 million through 2020. In addition, Peabody recently amended contracts to reduce certain U.S. transportation and logistics costs expected to be due in early 2017. In connection with these amendments, Peabody will realize a net reduction of $45 million in estimated liquidated damage payments that otherwise would have come due in early 2017. With respect to the collateral package under the secured credit facilities, total consolidated net tangible assets were $9.5 billion at the end of the year, with $3.4 billion in principal property and $1.7 billion in non-principal property. Under the credit agreement, compliance is also an area of interest. And I would point out that our reported adjusted EBITDA differs from the terms used for calculating compliance in the credit agreement. For example, the adjustments may include, in certain instances, cash proceeds from asset monetization activities. As a reminder, our credit agreement financial covenants include a minimum one-to-one interest coverage ratio and a maximum 4.5 times net secured leverage ratio. Turning to our 2016 outlook, first quarter results will include a gain of approximately $70 million from the UMWA settlement. Compared with the fourth quarter, we are expecting lower first quarter results for Mining segments due to long haul moves in Australia and Colorado, lower realized pricing and volumes, and expect hedge realizations to improve as the year proceeds. For full-year 2016, we expect decreased volumes across the platform, challenged prices and a continued cost emphasis. Full-year financial targets include the following. Reducing our U.S. sales volume targets by 18 million tons to 28 million tons from 2015 levels. We are now fully priced in 2016 as we eliminated all uncommitted production in response to market conditions. Our fully priced 2016 sales position includes 116 million tons of PRB priced at an average of $13.30 per ton. U.S. revenue and cost per ton targets were sensitive to a change in mix from expected lower PRB volumes and reduced fuel expense. We are pleased to be stabilizing costs given the impact of the current production mix and significantly lower planned volume levels. We are reducing Australian Met volume to 14 million tons to 15 million tons after taking into account the production cutbacks and cost improvement efforts made last year. Even with reduced volumes, we are lowering our overall Australian cost per ton range to $45 per ton to $48 per ton to reflect the benefit of declining currency and fuel expense, and ongoing cost containment efforts. In addition, we are reducing SG&A expense another 12% to 18% to $145 million to $155 million as we expect to realize a full-year benefit of the steps we took in the second quarter of 2015 to streamline and delayer the organization. And finally, we are lowering CapEx to $120 million to $140 million with a focus on safety initiatives and sustaining lower production levels as we continue to benefit from a relatively younger set of equipment. That's a brief review of our 2015 performance and our 2016 outlook. Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\n",
      "Glenn L. Kellow - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Amy, and good morning, everyone. It is clear as we look at Peabody's position against the industry backdrop that we actually face two stark contrasts. On the one hand, we have the punishing effects of depressed commodity markets on earnings, cash flow, and securities prices as we travel through some of the darkest days of the downturn. On the other hand, early last year, we outlined four areas of emphasis and our entire workforce delivered everything that was asked of them. We drove significant improvements in costs and CapEx management, implemented a leaner organization, and advanced multiple work streams to shape the portfolio and advance our financial objectives. Above all of our efforts, I'm pleased to note that, in 2015, our team achieved the best global safety incidence rate in our 133-year history, a 13% improvement over our previous best in 2014. The bottom line, though, is that we realize that while we took two steps forward in the past year, market headwinds have pushed us three steps back. Even with as much progress as we made in 2015, significantly more needs to be done. Today, I'll discuss the key advancements across the platform and highlight our core priorities for 2016 as the team takes further action in what already is another challenging year. Let's first look at current market dynamics. During the past year, sluggish global economic growth drove a broad collapse in commodity pricing both in energy and mining sectors. Despite acceleration in supply cutbacks, seaborne coal prices continue to wane amid a sharp decline in coal demand. And in the U.S., a weaker energy market, mild weather, and surplus natural gas with the lower prices and reduced coal consumption. China continued to be the primary driver for macro concerns as the country's annual GDP fell to the lowest pace in 25 years with steel and energy-intensive sectors impacted disproportionately. As a result, domestic steel demand declined last year, which pushed China's steel exports to a record of over 110 million tons in 2015. The dramatic rise in China's steel and coke competition in turn affected other steel production and impacted demand in seaborne metallurgical coal in other regions. Seaborne metallurgical coal quarterly settlements declined some 30% over the past year. Also in 2015, seaborne thermal coal prices fell to multi-year lows on reduced European demand and a nearly 75 million ton decline in China's imports. As expected, seaborne met coal shipments fell below 300 million tons in 2015 with exports declining from the U.S. and Canada in the back half of the year. While Australian exports are projected to increase slightly in 2016, we project further reductions from the U.S. to offset this growth, leading to an easing in overall seaborne supply. We are seeing similar trends unfold in seaborne thermal coal markets as weaker demand led to supply rationalization, primarily in the U.S. and Indonesia. And we expect to see further supply reductions from the U.S. producers facing greater pressure from lower pricing. We've recently seen some trends throughout the supply/demand balance; China is taking steps to reduce overcapacity in domestic steel and coal production, China's declining PMI numbers showed signs of stabilizing, and India is beginning to fill part of the void as the fastest-growing large economy. Still, there is no question as we review the global markets that these positive indicators are overshadowed by near-term concerns. Looking now to the U.S. coal market, 2015 U.S. coal demand fell approximately 110 million tons, a drop that exceeded our third quarter estimates due to mild weather and a steady decline in natural gas prices, which hit seasonal lows including spot prices below $2 in December, levels not seen since the early 2000s. As a result, coal declined to 34% of U.S. electricity compared to 40% in the prior year. Natural gas remained the primary beneficiary, representing 31% of total generation. Low natural gas prices also kept capacity utilization and coal fuel generation at modest levels averaging 55%. At the same time, reduced coal demand led to an elevated utility inventory build that reached a record high by year end. And in response, U.S. coal supply declined more than 100 million tons with cutbacks accelerating in the fourth quarter. You will recall that, in our estimates, PRB coal remains economic even with $2.50 to $2.75 natural gas prices and compares favorably to the Illinois Basin with a delivered cost of $3.50 to $3.75, and Central Appalachia to the $4.00 to $4.50 range per mmBtu. This offers a sign of how economics would improve in an environment where natural gas prices are expected to increase over time. Demonstrating the competitive position of our portfolio, Peabody represented only 9% of the overall decline in supply in the fourth quarter, even as we accounted for approximately 20% of all U.S. coal production last year. We regard our PRB portfolio as second to none. We have more than 25 years of production, and our reserves are located on the right side of the joint line. This represents long-term security of supply and an advantage over competitors in this region. Nonetheless, we believe that the Administration's recent actions regarding review of the federal coal leasing program represents poor policy and a flawed way to accomplish environmental goals. As I mentioned, in the third quarter, we expect 2016 coal demand by utilities to fall below 2015 levels, now projected at around 40 million tons to 60 million tons, assuming lower natural gas prices, and projected plant retirements. We anticipate decreased U.S. production of 150 million tons to 170 million tons in response to lower use, significant utility destocking, and reduced exports. In fact, nearly 20% of that expected reduction looks to have taken place in January alone based on industry shipment data. In response, Peabody is lowering our U.S. volume targets by 10% to 15% to a level consistent with customer commitments, as we believe there will be very limited opportunities to sell uncommitted volume. We plan to continue to work with our customers to match supply with demand in this market, and look to preserve contract value. We also continue to modify our production plans based on market needs. I would note the recent reduction of 75 positions at our Midwest Arclar Complex, and we are currently leveraging our flexibility in our three mine position in the PRB, but being able to redeploy employees, equipment, and contracts to maximize cash and margins. Our strategic focus on coal regions gives us the ability to manage basins as portfolios as opposed to individual mines. And, whilst we fully expect 2016 to be another trying year for the U.S. coal industry, we continue to believe that our leading positions in the lowest-cost basins will best position us to benefit from any rise in natural gas prices and coal demand over time. With that overview of the coal markets, I'd now like to discuss our priorities for 2016 as we build upon previous successes across the organization. First, we will strive to continuous improvement in safety, productivity, and costs across the platform. Safety is our first value. And, as I've mentioned, 2015 was the safest year in Peabody's history in terms of reportable incidents. At the mine level, we saw strong underlying performance with lower unit costs despite lower volumes, which is a credit to each of our mines and their teams. Operating costs declined sharply in both the U.S. and Australia and gross margins across four of our five operating segments averaged 26%. At the same time, both capital spending and SG&A were reduced to the lowest level in nearly a decade as we completed initiatives to delayer and streamline the organization. Our second core priority is to preserve liquidity and reduce debt. As you know, we have been pursuing multiple actions for some time as part of our new financial objectives. Along with our advisors, we've engaged in discussions with holders of several tranches of our debt to evaluate potential financial alternatives to preserve liquidity and delever the balance sheet. These discussions are towards several ends. We seek to reduce interest expense, which in 2015 was the largest part of our fixed charges. Capture discount based on the levels of our public debt prices and extend maturities to offer a greater runway toward longer term improvements in the coal markets. As you have seen, we've explored new debt instruments, including potential debt exchanges, debt buybacks, and new financing. We recognize that these are complex challenges, particularly given the volatility in the coal and capital markets. While no agreements have been reached at this time, we expect to continue discussions with debt holders where appropriate. We will give strong consideration to elements that include economics, runway, interest expense, and timing. There is no doubt our debt and equity are trading at distressed levels, which is indicative of the headwinds the industry is facing. You may recall last quarter that I noted it was as important to enact the right deal as a quick deal and unfortunately the continued deterioration in the capital markets validated this. But this remains the absolute financial priority of the corporation. Given the sensitive timing of this call relative to activities that are underway, we cannot provide further details on these strategies at this time. We do intend to continue to update as appropriate. Our third core priority is to continue to shape our portfolio to unlock value. In 2015 the company realized cash proceeds of $70 million related to ongoing resource management activities through the sale of surplus land and coal reserves. In the fourth quarter, we announced the planned sale of our New Mexico and Colorado assets for $358 million and the purchaser is currently arranging financing. In addition, Peabody recently announced plans to sell our 5% interest in the Prairie State Energy Campus for $57 million. Prairie State represents some of the cleanest and lowest-cost coal fuel generation in the company. It also represents a good example of us monetizing non-core assets to pull forward cash for liquidity or debt reduction purposes. We will continue to evaluate such transactions based on strategic fit, value considerations, potential growth, and cash requirements. There is no question that the industry backdrop has been challenging. Not to mention the fact that several of our peers have filed for bankruptcy in the last year. Peabody is not immune to these external pressures as evidenced by our earnings, cash flows, and pricing of our public instruments. That doesn't change, though, the underlying strength of a platform that continues to excel on many levels. Peabody has an unmatched asset base, operated by the best workforce in the industry. We have made tremendous advancements to mitigate the impacts of declining markets through cost saving initiatives, organizational improvements, and portfolio optimization efforts. And we recognize that we have much more to do in 2016 as we take the necessary steps to maintain competitiveness, preserve liquidity, and delever our balance sheet. With that, I would like to thank everyone for joining our call this morning and extend my appreciation to the entire Peabody team for your extensive efforts in the face of some very challenging market conditions. As we've noted, we will not be hosting a Q&A session given the fluid status of our ongoing liability management activities. We will continue to keep you apprised of our actions through appropriate disclosures as our progress advances. Thank you for your interest in BTU. And, John, that concludes our call.\n",
