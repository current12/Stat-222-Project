      "Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only. This conference is being recorded by AbbVie. I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin sir.\n",
      "Larry Peepo: Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Rick will begin by discussing AbbVie’s results from the second quarter and then provide an update on our pipeline and some of the key milestones we expect this year. Bill will give a more detailed review of our quarterly performance and then provide an overview of our 2014 outlook. As a reminder we are currently operating under the UK takeover code and will be until the Shire transaction is completed. The UK takeover code governs what we are able to disclose regarding the specifics of the transaction as well as the various aspects of AbbVie’s underlying business, including operating performance, product details and pipeline milestones. To help investors we have added a Q&A section to our earnings news release today which addresses a number of typical questions we receive. Due to the UK takeover code we will only be providing prepared remarks during our conference call today. There will not be a question-and-answer portion of today’s call. Before I turn the call over to Rick I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie’s operations is included in our 20\n"

    "In 2014, our company achieved significant milestones: we increased our staff to 150 employees, improved our efficiency by 13%, and reached a revenue of $75 million. During this period, our stock value appreciated by 15.23%, and we successfully launched a new product that generated $0.75 in earnings per share. Our research team, created 13 years ago, played a crucial role in this success, contributing insights that led to a market expansion of 255 new locations. Additionally, our long-term investments matured, yielding a substantial return of 234,455.23 dollars, setting us on a solid path for the next 18 months. $123,123.4. covid-19 and 10-K. \n"
