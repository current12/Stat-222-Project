      "MDNA     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations The following table sets forth net sales and income by reportable segment and on a consolidated basis: (1)  After elimination of intra- and intersegment sales, which are not significant in amount.   (2)  Segment operating income represents net sales less all direct costs and expenses (including certain administrative and other expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include interest expense.   Results of operations for the second quarter of 2014 compared with the second quarter of 2013 For the quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Company established records for orders, sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income and diluted earnings per share. The Company achieved these results from strong internal sales growth in both the Electronic Instruments Group (\"EIG\") and Electromechanical Group (\"EMG\"), contributions from the acquisitions of Zygo Corporation in June 2014, Luphos GmbH in May 2014, VTI Instruments (\"VTI\") in February 2014, Teseq Group in January 2014, Powervar, Inc. in December 2013, Creaform, Inc. in October 2013, and Controls Southeast (\"CSI\") in August 2013, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives. The full year impact of the 2014 and 2013 acquisitions and our continued focus on and implementation of Operational Excellence initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on the remainder of our 2014 results. Net sales for the second quarter of 2014 were $990.7 million, an increase of $111.9 million or 12.7%, compared with net sales of $878.8 million for the second quarter of 2013. The increase in net sales for the second quarter of 2014 was attributable to higher order rates which drove internal sales growth of approximately 4%, acquisitions added 8% and foreign currency translation was a favorable 1% effect. Total international sales for the second quarter of 2014 were $550.3 million or 55.5% of net sales, an increase of $76.0 million or 16.0%, compared with international sales of $474.3 million or 54.0% of net sales for the second quarter of 2013. The $76.0 million increase in international sales resulted from higher sales growth and the acquisitions mentioned above, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia. New orders for the second quarter of 2014 were $1,078.6 million, an increase of $183.7 million or 20.5%, compared with $894.9 million for the second quarter of 2013. The increase in orders for the second quarter of 2014 was due to internal order growth of approximately 2%, acquisitions added 18% and foreign currency translation was a favorable 1% effect. As a result, the Company's backlog of unfilled orders was a record at June 30, 2014 of $1,251.0 million, an increase of $111.0 million or 9.7%, compared with $1,140.0 million at December 31, 2013. Results of Operations (continued) Segment operating income for the second quarter of 2014 was $243.6 million, an increase of $30.6 million or 14.4%, compared with segment operating income of $213.0 million for the second quarter of 2013. The increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions and internal sales growth mentioned above, as well as the benefits of the Company's Operational Excellence initiatives. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 24.6% for the second quarter of 2014, compared with 24.2% for the second quarter of 2013. The increase in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the benefits of the Company's Operational Excellence initiatives. Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses for the second quarter of 2014 were $113.3 million, an increase of $18.4 million or 19.4%, compared with $94.9 million for the second quarter of 2013. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.4% for the second quarter of 2014, compared with 10.8% for the second quarter of 2013. Selling expenses increased $16.9 million or 20.0% for the second quarter of 2014 primarily driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 10.3% for the second quarter of 2014, compared with 9.6% for the second quarter of 2013. Base business selling expenses increased approximately 6% for the second quarter of 2014, which was in line with internal sales growth (net of foreign currency translation). Corporate administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2014 were $11.8 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 14.6%, compared with $10.3 million for the second quarter of 2013. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.2% for both the second quarter of 2014 and 2013. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher consulting and compensation-related expenses. Consolidated operating income was $231.7 million or 23.4% of net sales for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $29.1 million or 14.4%, compared with $202.6 million or 23.1% of net sales for the second quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2014 was 28.0%, compared with 29.4% for the second quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate for 2014 reflects a higher proportion of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, as well as the ongoing benefit of international tax planning initiatives. Net income for the second quarter of 2014 was $150.1 million, an increase of $21.8 million or 17.0%, compared with $128.3 million for the second quarter of 2013. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2014 were $0.61, an increase of $0.09 or 17.3%, compared with $0.52 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2013. Results of Operations (continued) Segment Results EIG's net sales totaled $573.3 million for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $90.0 million or 18.6%, compared with $483.3 million for the second quarter of 2013. The net sales increase included internal sales growth of approximately 4% and foreign currency translation was a favorable 1% effect. The acquisitions of VTI, Teseq, Powervar, Creaform and CSI accounted for the remainder of the net sales increase. EIG's operating income was $151.5 million for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $21.9 million or 16.9%, compared with $129.6 million for the second quarter of 2013. EIG's increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales mentioned above. EIG's operating margins were 26.4% of net sales for the second quarter of 2014, compared with 26.8% of net sales for the second quarter of 2013. EIG's decrease in operating margins was driven by the impact of the recent acquisitions, which have lower operating margins than the Group's base businesses, partially offset by the benefit of the Group's Operational Excellence initiatives. EMG's net sales totaled $417.4 million for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $21.9 million or 5.5%, compared with $395.5 million for the second quarter of 2013. The net sales increase included internal sales growth of approximately 4%, with foreign currency translation driving the remaining increase. EMG's operating income was $92.1 million for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $8.7 million or 10.4%, compared with $83.4 million for the second quarter of 2013. EMG's operating margins were 22.1% of net sales for the second quarter of 2014, compared with 21.1% of net sales for the second quarter of 2013. EMG's increase in operating income and operating margins was primarily due to the benefit of the Group's Operational Excellence initiatives on higher sales. Results of Operations (continued) Results of operations for the first six months of 2014 compared with the first six months of 2013 Net sales for the first six months of 2014 were $1,966.0 million, an increase of $204.3 million or 11.6%, compared with net sales of $1,761.7 million for the first six months of 2013. The increase in net sales for the first six months of 2014 was attributable to higher order rates which drove internal sales growth of approximately 4%, acquisitions added 7% and foreign currency translation was a favorable 1% effect. Total international sales for the first six months of 2014 were $1,098.6 million or 55.9% of net sales, an increase of $139.5 million or 14.5%, compared with international sales of $959.1 million or 54.4% of net sales for the first six months of 2013. The $139.5 million increase in international sales resulted from higher sales growth and the acquisitions mentioned above, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia. New orders for the first six months of 2014 were $2,077.0 million, an increase of $304.2 million or 17.2%, compared with $1,772.8 million for the first six months of 2013. The increase in orders for the first six months of 2014 was due to internal order growth of approximately 2% primarily driven by EIG, acquisitions added 13% and foreign currency translation was a favorable 2% effect. Segment operating income for the first six months of 2014 was $477.8 million, an increase of $55.1 million or 13.0%, compared with segment operating income of $422.7 million for the first six months of 2013. The increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions and internal sales growth mentioned above, as well as the benefits of the Company's Operational Excellence initiatives. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 24.3% for the first six months of 2014, compared with 24.0% for the first six months of 2013. The increase in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the benefits of the Company's Operational Excellence initiatives. SG&A expenses for the first six months of 2014 were $225.9 million, an increase of $33.4 million or 17.4%, compared with $192.5 million for the first six months of 2013. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.5% for the first six months of 2014, compared with 10.9% for the first six months of 2013. Selling expenses increased $31.9 million or 18.8% for the first six months of 2014 primarily driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 10.3% for the first six months of 2014, compared with 9.6% for the first six months of 2013.

Corporate administrative expenses for the first six months of 2014 were $24.2 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 6.6%, compared with $22.7 million for the first six months of 2013. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.2% for the first six months of 2014, compared with 1.3% for the first six months of 2013. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher consulting and compensation-related expenses. Consolidated operating income was $453.4 million or 23.1% of net sales for the first six months of 2014, an increase of $53.6 million or 13.4%, compared with $399.8 million or 22.7% of net sales for the first six months of 2013. Interest expense was $37.8 million for the first six months of 2014, an increase of $1.3 million or 3.6%, compared with $36.5 million for the first six months of 2013. The increase was due to higher borrowings under revolving credit facilities to help fund the recent acquisitions. Other expenses, net were $8.2 million for the first six months of 2014, an increase of $3.0 million, compared with $5.2 million for the first six months of 2013. The increase was primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses. Results of Operations (continued) The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2014 was 28.6%, compared with 29.2% for the first six months of 2013. The effective tax rate for 2014 reflects a higher proportion of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, as well as the ongoing benefit of international tax planning initiatives. The first six months of 2013 effective tax rate reflected the retroactive extension of the U.S. research and development tax credit. This credit was not extended into 2014. Net income for the first six months of 2014 was $290.6 million, an increase of $37.1 million or 14.6%, compared with $253.5 million for the first six months of 2013. Diluted earnings per share for the first six months of 2014 were $1.18, an increase of $0.15 or 14.6%, compared with $1.03 per diluted share for the first six months of 2013. Segment Results EIG's net sales totaled $1,145.7 million for the first six months of 2014, an increase of $177.9 million or 18.4%, compared with $967.8 million for the first six months of 2013. The net sales increase included internal sales growth of approximately 5%. The acquisitions of VTI, Teseq, Powervar, Creaform and CSI accounted for the remainder of the net sales increase. Foreign currency translation was flat quarter over quarter. EIG's operating income was $301.8 million for the first six months of 2014, an increase of $40.5 million or 15.5%, compared with $261.3 million for the first six months of 2013. EIG's increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales mentioned above. EIG's operating margins were 26.3% of net sales for the first six months of 2014, compared with 27.0% of net sales for the first six months of 2013. EIG's decrease in operating margins was driven by the impact of the recent acquisitions, which have lower operating margins than the Group's base businesses, partially offset by the benefit of the Group's Operational Excellence initiatives. EMG's net sales totaled $820.3 million for the first six months of 2014, an increase of $26.5 million or 3.3%, compared with $793.8 million for the first six months of 2013. The net sales increase included internal sales growth of approximately 2% and foreign currency translation was a favorable 1% effect. EMG's operating income was $176.0 million for the first six months of 2014, an increase of $14.6 million or 9.0%, compared with $161.4 million for the first six months of 2013. EMG's operating margins were 21.5% of net sales for the first six months of 2014, compared with 20.3% of net sales for the first six months of 2013. EMG's increase in operating income and operating margins was primarily due to the benefit of the Group's Operational Excellence initiatives on higher sales. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $316.0 million for the first six months of 2014, an increase of $31.0 million or 10.9%, compared with $285.0 million for the first six months of 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $37.1 million increase in net income, partially offset by higher overall operating working capital levels necessary to grow the Company's businesses. Free cash flow (cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was $286.8 million for the first six months of 2014, compared with $263.4 million for the first six months of 2013. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $511.1 million for the first six months of 2014, compared with $451.8 million for the first six months of 2013. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they are measures used by third parties in evaluating the Company. Cash used for investing activities totaled $485.7 million for the first six months of 2014, compared with $17.2 million for the first six months of 2013.

Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $29.3 million for the first six months of 2014, compared with $21.6 million for the first six months of 2013. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $158.1 million for the first six months of 2014, compared with $214.1 million of cash used for financing activities for the first six months of 2013. The change in financing cash flow was primarily the result of a net total borrowings increase of $180.9 million for the first six months of 2014 to partially fund the 2014 acquisitions, compared with a net total borrowings decrease of $194.1 million for the first six months of 2013. For the first six months of 2014, the Company repurchased approximately 33,000 shares of the Company's common stock for $1.7 million, compared with $8.5 million used for repurchases of approximately 206,000 shares of the Company's common stock for the first six months of 2013. At June 30, 2014, $90.7 million was available under a Board authorization for future share repurchases. Cash dividends paid for the first six months of 2014 were $36.7 million, compared with $29.2 million of cash dividends paid for the first six months of 2013. On May 8, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate on the Company's common stock to $0.09 per common share from $0.06 per common share. The dividend was paid on June 30, 2014 to stockholders of record on June 16, 2014. At June 30, 2014, total debt outstanding was $1,602.7 million, compared with $1,415.1 million at December 31, 2013, with no significant maturities until the third quarter of 2015. The debt-to-capital ratio was 31.9% at June 30, 2014, compared with 31.1% at December 31, 2013. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders' equity) was 27.8% at June 30, 2014, compared with 26.3% at December 31, 2013. The net debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this measure is used by third parties in evaluating the Company. As a result of all of the Company's cash flow activities for the first six months of 2014, cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2014 totaled $282.8 million, compared with $295.2 million at December 31, 2013. At June 30, 2014, the Company had $258.9 million in cash outside the United States, compared with $291.4 million at December 31, 2013. The Company utilizes this cash to operate its international operations, as well as acquire international businesses. In January 2014, the Company acquired a Swiss company, Teseq Group, for approximately 78 million Swiss francs (approximately $87 million). The Company is in compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants, for all of its debt agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.

      "MDNA     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations The following table sets forth net sales and income by reportable segment and on a consolidated basis: (1)  After elimination of intra- and intersegment sales, which are not significant in amount.   (2)  Segment operating income represents net sales less all direct costs and expenses (including certain administrative and other expenses) applicable to each segment, but does not include interest expense.   Results of operations for the third quarter of 2013 compared with the third quarter of 2012 For the quarter ended September 30, 2013, the Company established records for sales and operating income. The Company achieved these results primarily through contributions from the acquisitions of Controls Southeast (\"CSI\") in August 2013 and Micro-Poise Measurement Systems (\"Micro-Poise\") in October 2012, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives. Also, in the third quarter of 2013, the Company recognized an $11.6 million gain on the sale of a facility that was largely offset by incremental growth investments in the businesses and higher acquisition-related expenses. The full year impact of the 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and our continued focus on and implementation of Operational Excellence initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on the remainder of our 2013 results. Net sales for the third quarter of 2013 were $890.0 million, an increase of $50.6 million or 6.0%, compared with net sales of $839.4 million for the third quarter of 2012. The increase in net sales for the third quarter of 2013 was attributable to the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above and internal sales growth of approximately 1%. Foreign currency translation was flat quarter over quarter. Total international sales for the third quarter of 2013 were $482.2 million or 54.2% of net sales, an increase of $44.4 million or 10.1%, compared with international sales of $437.8 million or 52.2% of net sales for the third quarter of 2012. The $44.4 million increase in international sales resulted primarily from the recent acquisitions noted above, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia. New orders for the third quarter of 2013 were $937.1 million, an increase of $136.9 million or 17.1%, compared with $800.2 million for the third quarter of 2012. For the third quarter of 2013, internal order growth was approximately 7%, excluding a 2% favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by the differentiated businesses of both Electronic Instruments Group (\"EIG\") and Electromechanical Group's (\"EMG\"), with 2013 and 2012 acquisitions accounting for the remainder of the increase. As a result, the Company's backlog of unfilled orders was a record at September 30, 2013 of $1,170.5 million, an increase of $58.2 million or 5.2%, compared with $1,112.3 million at December Results of Operations (continued) Segment operating income for the third quarter of 2013 was $216.4 million, an increase of $17.5 million or 8.8%, compared with segment operating income of $198.9 million for the third quarter of 2012. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 24.3% for the third quarter of 2013, compared with 23.7% for the third quarter of 2012. The increase in segment operating income and segment operating margins resulted primarily from an $11.6 million gain on the sale of a facility that was partially offset by incremental growth investments in the businesses. Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses for the third quarter of 2013 were $99.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 3.1%, compared with $96.0 million for the third quarter of 2012. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.1% for the third quarter of 2013, compared with 11.4% for the third quarter of 2012. Selling expenses increased $2.0 million or 2.3% for the third quarter of 2013 primarily driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 9.8% for the third quarter of 2013, compared with 10.2% for the third quarter of 2012. Base business selling expenses decreased approximately 1% for the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to cost containment initiatives. Corporate administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2013 were $11.6 million, an increase of $0.9 million or 8.4%, compared with $10.7 million for the third quarter of 2012. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.3% for both the third quarter of 2013 and 2012. Consolidated operating income was $204.7 million or 23.0% of net sales for the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $16.5 million or 8.8%, compared with $188.2 million or 22.4% of net sales for the third quarter of 2012. Other expenses, net were $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $2.8 million, compared with $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher acquisition-related expenses. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2013 was 29.0%, compared with 30.4% for the third quarter of 2012. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2013 reflects the higher proportion of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates. The effective tax rate for 2013 and 2012 includes the impact of the ongoing benefits obtained from international tax planning initiatives including benefits from foreign tax credits. Net income for the third quarter of 2013 was $127.9 million, an increase of $12.5 million or 10.8%, compared with $115.4 million for the third quarter of 2012. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2013 were $0.52, an increase of $0.05 or 10.6%, compared with $0.47 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2012. Results of Operations (continued) Segment Results EIG's net sales totaled $499.8 million for the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $42.7 million or 9.3%, compared with $457.1 million for the third quarter of 2012. The net sales increase was driven by the acquisitions of CSI and Micro-Poise and internal sales growth of approximately 1%. Foreign currency translation was flat quarter over quarter. EIG's operating income was $138.9 million for the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $17.3 million or 14.2%, compared with $121.6 million for the third quarter of 2012. EIG's operating margins were 27.8% of net sales for the third quarter of 2013, compared with 26.6% of net sales for the third quarter of 2012. EIG's increase in operating margins was primarily due to a $11.6 million gain on the sale of a facility, partially offset by incremental growth investments in the businesses. EMG's net sales totaled $390.2 million for the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $7.9 million or 2.1%, compared with $382.3 million for the third quarter of 2012. The net sales increase was due to internal sales growth of approximately 1% driven by EMG's floorcare and specialty motors businesses and a favorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation. EMG's operating income was $77.5 million for the third quarter of 2013, essentially flat compared with $77.3 million for the third quarter of 2012. EMG's operating margins were 19.9% of net sales for the third quarter of 2013, compared with 20.2% of net sales for the third quarter of 2012 as strength in EMG's floorcare and specialty motors businesses was offset by weaker performance in EMG's differentiated businesses. Results of Operations (continued) Results of operations for the first nine months of 2013 compared with the first nine months of 2012 Net sales for the first nine months of 2013 were $2,651.7 million, an increase of $159.3 million or 6.4%, compared with net sales of $2,492.4 million for the first nine months of 2012. The increase in net sales for the first nine months of 2013 was attributable to the impact of the acquisitions of CSI in August 2013, Micro-Poise in October 2012 and Dunkermotoren GmbH in May 2012. Internal sales growth and foreign currency translation were flat period over period. Total international sales for the first nine months of 2013 were $1,441.4 million or 54.4% of net sales, an increase of $174.8 million or 13.8%, compared with international sales of $1,266.6 million or 50.8% of net sales for the first nine months of 2012. The $174.8 million increase in international sales resulted primarily from the acquisitions of Dunkermotoren and Micro-Poise, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia. New orders for the first nine months of 2013 were $2,710.0 million, an increase of $130.6 million or 5.1%, compared with $2,579.4 million for the first nine months of 2012. The increase in orders was primarily attributable to 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and internal order growth of approximately 1%. As a result, the Company's backlog of unfilled orders was a record at September 30, 2013 of $1,170.5 million, an increase of $58.2 million or 5.2%, compared with $1,112.3 million at December 31, 2012. Segment operating income for the first nine months of 2013 was $639.1 million, an increase of $49.9 million or 8.5%, compared with segment operating income of $589.2 million for the first nine months of 2012. The increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as the benefits of the Company's lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 24.1% for the first nine months of 2013, compared with 23.6% for the first nine months of 2012. The increase in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the benefits of the Company's lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives. SG&A expenses for the first nine months of 2013 were $291.5 million, an increase of $4.8 million or 1.7%, compared with $286.7 million for the first nine months of 2012. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.0% for the first nine months of 2013, compared with 11.5% for the first nine months of 2012. Selling expenses increased $3.5 million or 1.4% for the first nine months of 2013 primarily driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 9.7% for the first nine months of 2013, compared with 10.2% for the first nine months of 2012. Base business selling expenses decreased approximately 4% for the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to cost containment initiatives. Corporate administrative expenses for the first nine months of 2013 were $34.3 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 3.6%, compared with $33.1 million for the first nine months of 2012. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.3% for both the first nine months of 2013 and Consolidated operating income was $604.5 million or 22.8% of net sales for the first nine months of 2013, an increase of $48.6 million or 8.7%, compared with $555.9 million or 22.3% of net sales for the first nine months of 2012. Interest expense was $54.7 million for the first nine months of 2013, a decrease of $1.9 million or 3.4%, compared with $56.6 million for the first nine months of 2012. The decrease was due to lower borrowings under revolving credit facilities. Other expenses, net were $11.5 million for the first nine months of 2013, an increase of $3.9 million, compared with $7.6 million for the first nine months of 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher acquisition-related expenses. Results of Operations (continued) The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2013 was 29.2%, compared with 31.0% for the first nine months of 2012. The effective tax rate for 2013 included the impact of the retroactive extension of the U.S. research and development tax credit, as well as reflects the higher proportion of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates. The effective tax rate for 2013 and 2012 includes the impact of the ongoing benefits obtained from international tax planning initiatives including benefits from foreign tax credits. Net income for the first nine months of 2013 was $381.3 million, an increase of $42.1 million or 12.4%, compared with $339.2 million for the first nine months of 2012. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2013 were $1.55, an increase of $0.16 or 11.5%, compared with $1.39 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2012. Segment Results EIG's net sales totaled $1,467.7 million for the first nine months of 2013, an increase of $89.7 million or 6.5%, compared with $1,378.0 million for the first nine months of 2012. The net sales increase was driven by the acquisitions of CSI and Micro-Poise. Internal sales growth and foreign currency translation were flat period over period. EIG's operating income was $400.3 million for the first nine months of 2013, an increase of $38.0 million or 10.5%, compared with $362.3 million for the first nine months of 2012. EIG's operating margins were 27.3% of net sales for the first nine months of 2013, compared with 26.3% of net sales for the first nine months of 2012. EIG's increase in operating margins was primarily due to a third quarter of 2013 $11.6 million gain on the sale of a facility, partially offset by incremental growth investments in the businesses recorded in the third quarter of 2013. EMG's net sales totaled $1,184.0 million for the first nine months of 2013, an increase of $69.6 million or 6.2%, compared with $1,114.4 million for the first nine months of 2012. The net sales increase was driven by the acquisition of Dunkermotoren. Internal sales growth and foreign currency translation were flat period over period. EMG's operating income was $238.9 million for the first nine months of 2013, an increase of $11.9 million or 5.2%, compared with $227.0 million for the first nine months of 2012. EMG's increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales mentioned above. EMG's operating margins were 20.2% of net sales for the first nine months of 2013, compared with 20.4% of net sales for the first nine months of 2012. EMG's decrease in operating margins was driven by weaker performance in its differentiated businesses, including the impact of the Dunkermotoren acquisition, which has a lower operating margin than the Group's base businesses. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities totaled $451.1 million for the first nine months of 2013, an increase of $31.9 million or 7.6%, compared with $419.2 million for the first nine months of 2012. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $42.1 million increase in net income. Free cash flow (cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was $414.0 million for the first nine months of 2013, compared with $385.9 million for the first nine months of 2012. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $679.5 million for the first nine months of 2013, compared with $625.7 million for the first nine months of 2012. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they are measures used by third parties in evaluating the Company. Cash used for investing activities totaled $183.5 million for the first nine months of 2013, compared with $530.4 million for the first nine months of 2012. For the first nine months of 2013, the Company paid $164.0 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire CSI in August 2013. For the first nine months of 2012, the Company paid $497.8 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire O'Brien Corporation in January 2012 and Dunkermotoren in May 2012. For the first nine months of 2013, the Company received $12.8 million for the sale of a facility. Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $37.1 million for the first nine months of 2013, compared with $33.3 million for the first nine months of 2012. Cash used for financing activities totaled $174.7 million for the first nine months of 2013, compared with $101.4 million of cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2012. The change in financing cash flow was primarily the result of the net total borrowings decrease of $154.8 million for the first nine months of 2013, compared with a net total borrowings increase of $100.8 million for the first nine months of 2012. For the first nine months of 2013, the Company repurchased 206,138 shares of the Company's common stock for $8.5 million, compared with $3.9 million used for repurchases of 120,430 shares for the first nine months of 2012. At September 30, 2013, $92.4 million was available under the Board authorization for future share repurchases. At September 30, 2013, total debt outstanding was $1,300.1 million, compared with $1,453.8 million at December 31, 2012, with no significant maturities until 2015. The debt-to-capital ratio was 30.7% at September 30, 2013, compared with 36.4% at December 31, 2012. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders' equity) was 26.3% at September 30, 2013, compared with 33.8% at December 31, 2012. The net debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this measure is used by third parties in evaluating the Company. As a result of all of the Company's cash flow activities for the first nine months of 2013, cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2013 totaled $254.9 million, compared with $158.0 million at December 31, 2012. At September 30, 2013, the Company had $241.7 million in cash outside the United States, compared with $150.6 million at December 31, 2012. The Company utilizes this cash to operate its international operations, as well as acquire international businesses. In October 2013, the Company acquired a Canadian company, Creaform, Inc., for approximately 125 million Canadian dollars (approximately $120 million). The Company is in compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants, for all of its debt agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.

      "MDNA     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplemental Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview Twitter is a global platform for public self-expression and conversation in real time. Our platform is unique in its simplicity: Tweets are limited to 140 characters of text. This constraint makes it easy for anyone to quickly create, distribute and discover content that is consistent across our platform and optimized for mobile devices. As a result, Tweets drive a high velocity of information exchange that makes Twitter uniquely “live.” We have already achieved significant global scale, and we continue to grow. We have more than 240 million MAUs spanning nearly every country. Our users include millions of people from around the world, as well as influential individuals and organizations, such as world leaders, government officials, celebrities, athletes, journalists, sports teams, media outlets and brands. Our users create approximately 500 million Tweets every day. The value we create for our users is enhanced by our platform partners and advertisers. Millions of platform partners, which include publishers, media outlets and developers, have integrated with Twitter, adding value to our user experience by contributing content to our platform, broadly distributing content from our platform across their properties and using Twitter content and tools to enhance their websites and applications. In addition, advertisers use our Promoted Products to promote their brands, products and services, amplify their visibility and reach, and complement and extend the conversation around their advertising campaigns. Although we do not generate revenue directly from users or platform partners, we benefit from network effects where more activity on Twitter results in the creation and distribution of more content, which attracts more users, platform partners and advertisers, resulting in a virtuous cycle of value creation. We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services, with the balance coming from data licensing arrangements and our mobile advertising exchange. We generate nearly all of our advertising revenue through the sale of our three Promoted Products: Promoted Tweets, Promoted Accounts and Promoted Trends. The substantial majority of our advertising revenue is generated on a pay-for-performance basis, which means advertisers are only charged when a user engages with their ad, creating an attractive value proposition for our advertisers. We launched our first Promoted Products in mid-2010 in the United States by introducing Promoted Tweets in search results and Promoted Trends. Since that time, we have expanded our Promoted Products to add Promoted Accounts and extended our Promoted Products across our platform and to additional geographies. We generate advertising sales in the United States and certain other geographies through our direct sales force, as well as through our self- serve advertising platform. We introduced Promoted Products on our iOS and Android mobile applications in February 2012. Over 70% of our advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices in the year ended December 31, 2013. Our international revenue was $172.6 and $53.0 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, representing 26% and 17% of our total revenue for those periods, respectively. We launched Promoted Products in selected international markets in the third quarter of 2011, and we expect to continue to launch our Promoted Products in additional markets over time. We have recently focused our international spending on sales support and marketing activities in specific countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. In certain international geographies where we have not invested to build a local sales force, we rely on resellers that serve as outside sales agents for the sale of our Promoted Products. In 2013, we and our resellers sold our Promoted Products to advertisers in over 20 countries outside of the United States. We record advertising revenue based on the billing location of our advertisers, rather than the location of our users. We are headquartered in San Francisco, California, and have offices in over 20 cities around the world. Key Metrics We review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions: Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define MAUs as Twitter users who have logged in and access Twitter through our website, mobile website, desktop or mobile applications, SMS or registered third-party applications or websites in the 30-day period ending on the date of measurement. Average MAUs for a period represent the average of the MAUs at the end of each month during the period. In the discussion of our results of operations we compare average MAUs for the last three months of each period discussed in such comparison. MAUs are a measure of the size of our active user base. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, we had 240.9 million average MAUs, which represents an increase of 30% from the three months ended December 31, 2012. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, we had 54.1 million average MAUs in the United States and 186.8 million average MAUs in the rest of the world, which represent increases of 21% and 33%, respectively, from the three months ended December 31, 2012. For additional information on how we calculate the number of timeline views and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled “Note Regarding Key Metrics.” Timeline Views, Timeline Views Per MAU and Advertising Revenue Per Timeline View. We define timeline views as the total number of timelines requested and delivered when registered users visit Twitter, refresh a timeline or view search results while logged in on our website, mobile website or desktop or mobile applications (excluding our TweetDeck and Mac clients, as we do not fully track this data). We believe that timeline views and timeline views per MAU are measures of user engagement. Timeline views per MAU are calculated by dividing the total timeline views for the period by the average MAUs for the last three months of such period. In the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, we had 147.8 billion and 593.8 billion timeline views, respectively, which represent increases of 26% and 55% from the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, respectively. In the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, we had 40.9 billion and 164.2 billion timeline views in the United States, respectively, which represent increases of 14% and 37% from the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, respectively. In the three months and year ended December 31, 2013, we had 106.9 billion and 429.5 billion timeline views in the rest of the world, respectively, which represent increases of 31% and 62% from the three months and year ended December 31, 2012, respectively. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, we had 613 timeline views per MAU, which represents an decrease of 3% from the three months ended December 31, 2012. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, we had 756 timeline views per MAU in the United States and 572 timeline views per MAU in the rest of the world, which represent decreases of 6% and 2% from the three months ended December 31, 2012, respectively. For additional information on how we calculate the number of timeline views and factors that can affect this metric, see the section titled “Note Regarding Key Metrics.” We define advertising revenue per timeline view as advertising revenue per 1,000 timeline views during the applicable period. We believe that advertising revenue per timeline view is a measure of our ability to monetize our platform. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, our advertising revenue per timeline view was $1.49, which represents a 76% increase from the three months ended December 31, 2012. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, our advertising revenue per timeline view in the United States was $3.80 and our advertising revenue per timeline view in the rest of the world was $0.60, which represent increases of 73% and 139% from the three months ended December 31, 2012, respectively. We record advertising revenue based on the billing location of our advertisers, rather than the location of our users. Factors Affecting Our Future Performance User Growth, User Engagement and Monetization. User growth trends reflected in the number of MAUs, user engagement trends reflected in timeline views and timeline views per MAU and monetization trends reflected in advertising revenue per timeline view are key factors that affect our revenue. As our user base and the level of engagement of our users grow, we believe the potential to increase our revenue grows. User Growth. We have experienced significant growth in our number of users over the last several years. In general, a higher proportion of Internet users in the United States uses Twitter than Internet users in other countries. Accordingly, in the future we expect our user growth rate in certain international markets, such as Argentina, France, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, to continue to be higher than our user growth rate in the United States. However, we expect to face challenges in entering some markets, such as China, where access to Twitter is blocked, as well as certain other countries that have intermittently restricted access to Twitter. Restrictions or limitations on access to Twitter may adversely impact our ability to increase the size of our user base and generate additional revenue in certain markets. Although we do not separately track whether an MAU has only used Twitter on a desktop or on a mobile device, the usage of our mobile applications continues to grow. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, 76% of our average MAUs accessed Twitter from a mobile device, compared to 72% in the three months ended December 31, 2012. We may face challenges in increasing the size of our user base, including, among others, competition from alternative products and services, a decline in the number of influential users on Twitter or a perceived decline in the quality of content available on Twitter. We intend to drive growth in our user base by continuing to demonstrate the value and usefulness of our products and services to potential new users, and by introducing new products, services and features. Our user growth rate has slowed over time, and we anticipate that it may continue to slow, with increases to the size of our user base. To the extent our user growth or user growth rate continues to slow, our revenue growth will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement, as measured by timeline views and timeline views per MAU, and monetization, as measured by advertising revenue per timeline view. User Engagement. Two broad measures of user engagement on our platform are timeline views and the number of timeline views per MAU. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, timeline views increased 26% and timeline views per MAU decreased 3%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2012. We experienced a 10% decline in timeline views per MAU during the three months ended December 31, 2013 from the three months ended September 30, 2013, which we believe was primarily driven by certain product changes we made in the three months ended December 31, 2013 to enhance user experience. Our most engaged users are generally those who access Twitter via our mobile applications. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, a substantial majority of timeline views were on mobile devices. We expect this trend to continue in the near term, and we plan to continue to develop and improve our mobile applications to further drive user adoption of these applications. We intend to continue to optimize our products to improve the overall user experience, and the changes we may make to our products may result in slower growth, or a decline, in the number of timeline views or the number of timeline views per MAU. To the extent user engagement as measured by timeline views and timeline views per MAU does not increase, our revenue growth will depend in large part on our ability to increase MAUs or monetization of our platform. Monetization. We measure monetization of our platform through advertising revenue per timeline view. There are many variables that impact timeline views and advertising revenue per timeline view, such as the number of MAUs, the number of timeline views per MAU, which timeline views we monetize and the amount of advertising we choose to display, our users’ engagement with our Promoted Products and advertiser demand. Generally, for our pay-for- performance Promoted Products, we design our algorithms to optimize for the combined impact of a number of factors, including the overall user experience, the number of ads we deliver to a particular user, the likelihood that our users will engage with the ads, the value we deliver to advertisers and the impact of the advertisers’ bids. We design our algorithms to enhance the user experience by delivering relevant ads to a user based on the user’s Interest Graph, and these ads may contain information of interest to the user or may provide promotional offers that are not available anywhere else. Our algorithms also enhance the value that we deliver to advertisers because the targeting capabilities of our algorithms allow advertisers to deliver ads that are relevant to a user’s interests, thereby increasing the effectiveness of an advertiser’s advertising campaign. We regularly refine our algorithms to drive monetization while maximizing the long-term value of our platform for our users and advertisers. Given the large number of variables that drive advertising revenue per timeline view, including decisions that we make regarding optimizing user experience and satisfying advertiser demand, certain individual components may decline while others increase. Ultimately, it is the combination of the changes in these components that impacts advertising revenue per timeline view. For example, advertising revenue has increased sequentially in each of the seven quarters ended December 31, 2013, driven by sequential increases in paid user engagements with our pay-for-performance Promoted Products, or ad engagements, over those same periods, partially offset by sequential decreases in average cost per ad engagement during the same periods. The number of ad engagements increased 55%, 32%, 78%, 15%, 124%, 58% and 74% sequentially in the three months ended June 30, 2012, September 30, 2012, December 31, 2012, March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The increases in ad engagements over these periods were primarily due to increases in MAUs, user engagement levels, as measured by timeline views per MAU, and advertiser demand. Average cost per ad engagement decreased 18%, 9%, 19%, 12%, 46%, 20% and 18% sequentially in the three months ended June 30, 2012, September 30, 2012, December 31, 2012, March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The decreases in cost per ad engagement over these periods were primarily driven by higher ad engagements as a result of continued improvements made to our ad products and our prediction and targeting capabilities. Supply of advertising inventory increased as we expanded the distribution of our Promoted Products to our mobile applications and additional markets outside of the United States in 2012. The increase in advertising inventory provided us with additional opportunities to place ads on our platform. This reduction in cost per ad engagement made our Promoted Products more attractive for our existing advertisers and new advertisers, including small and medium sized businesses with smaller advertising budgets, as well as international advertisers. As we continue to optimize for advertiser value and the overall user experience, the cost per ad engagement may continue to decline over time, and we expect the cost per ad engagement to decline in the near term. In the event that cost per ad engagement continues to decline, and we are unable to continue to offset the impact of such decreases on advertising revenue by increasing the number of ad engagements, our advertising revenue would decline. We believe that, in order to increase the cost per ad engagement, we will need to increase advertiser demand for our Promoted Products by enhancing the value of such products. We plan to increase the value of our Promoted Products by increasing the size and engagement of our user base, improving our ability to target advertising to our users’ interests and improving the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns. We also believe our goal of maximizing the long-term value of our platform for our users and advertisers should make Promoted Products more attractive to our existing and new advertisers and allow us to deliver more relevant ads on our platform. In addition, our advertising revenue per timeline view in the United States is substantially higher than our advertising revenue per timeline view in the rest of the world. For example, during the three months ended December 31, 2013, our advertising revenue per timeline view in the United States was $3.80 and our advertising revenue per timeline view in the rest of the world was $0.60. We expect this disparity to continue for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, to the extent the number of international users and engagement by international users grow faster than U.S. users and engagement by U.S. users, total advertising revenue per timeline view may be adversely impacted even if total advertising revenue continues to increase. We have also been able to generate significant revenue through our mobile applications. We introduced Promoted Products on our iOS and Android mobile applications in February 2012, and have since expanded to include Promoted Products on our other mobile applications. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, over 75% of our advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. We have experienced strong growth in advertising revenue from mobile devices because user engagement, as measured by timeline views, is significantly higher on mobile applications than on our desktop applications, and we expect this trend to continue. However, Promoted Accounts and Promoted Trends receive less prominence on our mobile applications than they do on our desktop applications, which means that fewer users see them displayed on our mobile applications, resulting in fewer ad engagements with Promoted Accounts and fewer impressions of Promoted Trends on mobile applications. Primarily as a result of Promoted Accounts and Promoted Trends receiving less prominence on mobile applications, we have generated higher advertising revenue per timeline view on our desktop applications than on our mobile applications. Although advertising revenue per timeline view on our desktop applications is higher than advertising revenue per timeline view on our mobile applications, the substantial majority of our timeline views and advertising revenue is generated from mobile applications. Accordingly, to the extent that user engagement on mobile applications continues to increase faster than user engagement on our desktop applications, advertising revenue per timeline view may be adversely impacted even if total advertising revenue continues to increase. We intend to continue to increase the monetization of our platform by improving the targeting capabilities of our advertising services to enhance the value of our Promoted Products for advertisers, expanding our sales efforts to reach advertisers in additional international markets, opening our platform to additional advertisers through our self-serve advertising platform and developing new ad formats for advertisers. Effectiveness of Our Advertising Services. Advertisers can use Twitter to communicate directly with their followers for free, but many choose to purchase our advertising services to reach a broader audience and further promote their brands, products and services. We believe that increasing the effectiveness of our Promoted Products for advertisers will increase the amount that advertisers spend with us. We aim to increase the value of our Promoted Products by increasing the size and engagement of our user base, improving our ability to target advertising to our users’ interests and improving the ability of our advertisers to optimize their campaigns and measure the results of their campaigns. We may also develop new advertising products and services. International Expansion. We intend to invest in our international operations in order to expand our user base and advertiser base and increase user engagement and monetization internationally. In the three months ended December 31, 2013, we had 186.8 million average MAUs internationally compared to 54.1 million average MAUs in the United States. In addition, our number of users is growing at a faster rate in many international markets, such as Argentina, France, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. However, we derive the substantial majority of our advertising revenue from advertisers in the United States. We also generate significantly more advertising revenue per timeline view in the United States than internationally, with advertising revenue per timeline view in the three months ended December 31, 2013 of $3.80 in the United States and $0.60 internationally. Further, because we record advertising revenue based on the billing location of our advertisers, engagement by international users with ads placed by advertisers located in the United States increases our advertising revenue per timeline view in the United States. In order to increase our international advertising revenue, we plan to invest in our international operations. In the near term, we plan to increase the size of our sales and marketing support teams in international markets such as Brazil, Canada, Ireland and Singapore, and we plan to extend our self-serve advertising platform to countries outside of the United States. We face challenges in increasing our advertising revenue internationally, including local competition, differences in advertiser demand, differences in the digital advertising market and conventions, and differences in the manner in which Twitter is accessed and used internationally. We face competition from well-established competitors in certain international markets, including Kakao in South Korea and LINE in Japan. In addition, certain international markets are not as familiar with digital advertising in general, or with new forms of digital advertising, such as our Promoted Products. In these jurisdictions we are investing to educate advertisers about the benefits of our advertising services. However, we expect that it may require a significant investment of time and resources to educate advertisers in many international markets. We also face challenges in providing certain advertising products, features or analytics in certain international markets, such as the European Union, due to government regulation. In addition, in certain emerging markets, many users access Twitter through feature phones with limited functionality, rather than through smartphones, our website or desktop applications. This limits our ability to deliver certain features to these users and may limit the ability of advertisers to deliver compelling ads to users in these markets. We are investing to improve our applications for feature phones in order to improve our ability to monetize our products and services in international markets. Competition. We face significant competition for users and advertisers. We compete against many companies to attract and engage users and for advertiser spend, including companies with greater financial resources and substantially larger user bases, such as Facebook (including Instagram), Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft and Yahoo!, which offer a variety of Internet and mobile device- based products, services and content. In recent years there have been significant acquisitions and consolidation by and among our actual and potential competitors. We must compete effectively for users and advertisers in order to grow our business and increase our revenue. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for users depends upon a number of factors, including the quality of our products and services; and our ability to compete effectively for advertisers depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to offer attractive advertising products with unique targeting capabilities and the size of our active user base. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to improve our products and services for users and advertisers and to grow our active user base in order to address the competitive challenges in our industry. As part of our strategy to improve our products and services, we may acquire other companies to add engineering talent or complementary products and technologies. Investment in Infrastructure. We intend to increase the capacity and enhance the capability and reliability of our infrastructure. Our infrastructure is critical to providing users, platform partners, advertisers and data partners access to our platform, particularly during major planned and unplanned events, such as elections, sporting events or natural disasters, when activity on our platform increases dramatically. As our user base and the activity on our platform grow, we expect that investments and expenses associated with our infrastructure will continue to grow. These investments and expenses include the expansion of our data center operations and related operating costs, additional servers and networking equipment to increase the capacity of our infrastructure and increased bandwidth costs. Products and Services Innovation. Our ability to increase the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and increase our revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to improve existing products and services and to successfully develop or acquire new products and services. We plan to continue to make significant investments in research and development and, from time to time, we may acquire companies to enhance our products, services and technical capabilities. Investment in Talent. We intend to invest in hiring and retaining talented employees to grow our business and increase our revenue. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 2,700 full-time employees, an increase of over 1,200 full-time employees, or approximately 86%, from December 31, 2012. We expect to grow headcount for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in our business. We have also made and intend to continue to make acquisitions that add engineers, designers, product managers and other personnel with specific technology expertise. In addition, we must retain our high-performing personnel in order to continue to develop, sell and market our products and services and manage our business. Seasonality. Advertising spending is traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each year. Historically, this seasonality in advertising spending has affected our quarterly results, with higher sequential advertising revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter compared to sequential advertising revenue growth from the fourth quarter to the subsequent first quarter. For example, our advertising revenue increased 63% and 45% between the third and fourth quarters of 2011 and 2012, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2012 and 2013 increased 37% and 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2012, respectively. In addition, advertising revenue per timeline view increased 31% between the third and fourth quarter of 2012, while advertising revenue per timeline view decreased 13% between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. The rapid growth in our business may have partially masked seasonality to date and the seasonal impacts may be more pronounced in the future. Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Since May 2011, we have been granting RSUs to our employees. The Pre-2013 RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition. The service condition for a majority of the Pre-2013 RSUs is satisfied over a period of four years. The performance condition was satisfied in February 2014 pursuant to the terms of the Pre-2013 RSUs. Prior to the closing of our initial public offering in November 2013, we had not recognized any stock-based compensation expense for the Pre-2013 RSUs, because the performance condition had not been satisfied. Upon completion of our initial public offering, we began recording the stock- based compensation expense related to Pre-2013 RSUs, because the satisfaction of the performance condition became probable. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $433.5 million of cumulative stock-based compensation expense related to the Pre-2013 RSUs. This amount is comprised of $405.9 million of expense accumulated until the effective date of our initial public offering for awards vested and $27.6 million of subsequent recognition of expense during the year as additional Pre-2013 RSUs continue to vest. We have an additional $158.6 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the Pre-2013 RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. In addition to stock-based compensation expense associated with the Pre-2013 RSUs, as of December 31, 2013, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $998.9 million related to other outstanding equity awards, after giving effect to estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. Further, we made grants of equity awards after December 31, 2013, and we have unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $44.5 million related to such equity awards, after giving effect to estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately four years. We have elected to allow our employees who are not executive officers to sell a limited number of shares of our common stock received upon the vesting and settlement of the Pre-2013 RSUs in February 2014 in the public market in order to satisfy their potential income tax obligations related to the vesting and settlement of such awards. In addition, we undertook a net settlement of vested Pre-2013 RSUs held by our executive officers upon satisfaction of the performance condition for the Pre-2013 RSUs in February 2014 and withheld shares and remitted income tax on behalf of the applicable executive officers in cash at the applicable minimum statutory rates. Components of Results of Operations Revenue We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services. We also generate revenue by licensing our data to third parties and providing mobile advertising exchange services. Advertising Services We generate substantially all of our advertising revenue by selling our Promoted Products. Currently, our Promoted Products consist of the following: Promoted Tweets. Promoted Tweets, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear within a user’s timeline or search results just like an ordinary Tweet regardless of device, whether it be desktop or mobile. Using our proprietary algorithms and understanding of the interests of each user, we can deliver Promoted Tweets that are intended to be relevant to a particular user. We enable our advertisers to target an audience based on our users’ Interest Graphs. Our Promoted Tweets are pay-for-performance advertising that are priced through an auction. We recognize advertising revenue when a user engages with a Promoted Tweet.   Promoted Accounts. Promoted Accounts, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear in the same format and place as accounts suggested by our Who to Follow recommendation engine, or in some cases, in Tweets in a user’s timeline. Promoted Accounts provide a way for our advertisers to grow a community of users who are interested in their business, products or services. Our Promoted Accounts are pay-for-performance advertising that are priced through an auction. We recognize advertising revenue when a user follows a Promoted Account.   Promoted Trends. Promoted Trends, which are labeled as “promoted,” appear at the top of the list of trending topics for an entire day in a particular country or on a global basis. When a user clicks on a Promoted Trend, search results for that trend are shown in a timeline and a Promoted Tweet created by the advertiser is displayed to the user at the top of those search results. We sell our Promoted Trends on a fixed-fee-per-day basis. We feature one Promoted Trend per day per geography, and recognize advertising revenue from a Promoted Trend when it is displayed on our platform.   Data Licensing and Other We generate data licensing and other revenue by (i) offering data licenses that allow our data partners to access, search and analyze historical and real-time data on our platform, which data consists of public Tweets and their content, and (ii) providing mobile advertising exchange services. Our data partners generally purchase licenses to access all or a portion of our data for a fixed period, which is typically two years. We recognize data licensing revenue as the licensed data is made available to our data partners. In the year ended December 31, 2013, our top five data partners accounted for approximately 72% of our data licensing revenue, and approximately 7% of total revenue in the period. We expect data licensing revenue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue over time. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of data center costs related to our co- located facilities, which include lease and hosting costs, related support and maintenance costs and energy and bandwidth costs, as well as depreciation of our servers and networking equipment, and personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our operations teams. Cost of revenue also includes allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and capitalized labor costs. Many of the elements of our cost of revenue are relatively fixed, and cannot be reduced in the near term to offset any decline in our revenue. We plan to continue increasing the capacity and enhancing the capability and reliability of our infrastructure to support user growth and increased activity on our platform. We expect that cost of revenue will increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future and vary in the near term from period to period as a percentage of revenue. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our engineers and other employees engaged in the research and development of our products and services. In addition, research and development expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets, allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We plan to continue to hire employees for our engineering, product management and design teams to support our research and development efforts. We expect that research and development costs will increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future and vary in the near term from period to period as a percentage of revenue. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, commissions, business development and media, marketing, corporate communications and customer service functions. In addition, marketing and sales-related expenses also include market research, tradeshows, branding, marketing, public relations costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to expand internationally, grow our advertiser base and increase our brand awareness. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future and vary in the near term from period to period as a percentage of revenue. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for our executive, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees and costs for professional services, including consulting, third- party legal and accounting services and facilities and other supporting overhead costs that are not allocated to other departments. We plan to continue to expand our business both domestically and internationally, and expect to increase the size of our general and administrative function to help grow our business. We expect that we will incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of being a newly-public company We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future and vary in the near term from period to period as a percentage of revenue. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, and deferred income taxes and changes in related valuation allowance reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2013, we had $429.3 million of federal and $268.3 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. These net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire for federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes in 2027 and 2014, respectively. We also have research credit carryforwards of $30.0 million and $24.0 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The federal research credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2027. The state research credit carryforward has no expiration date. Additionally, the Company has California Enterprise Zone credit carryforwards of $12.6 million which will begin to expire in 2023. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations set forth in the Code, and similar state provisions. Any annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and research credits before utilization. Results of Operations The following tables set forth our consolidated statement of operations data for each of the periods presented: Costs and expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows:   The following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for each of the periods presented as a percentage of revenue: Years Ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 Revenue 2013 Compared to 2012. Revenue in 2013 increased by $348.0 million compared to In 2013, advertising revenue increased by 121% compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to a 55% increase in timeline views in 2013 compared to 2012, as well as an increase in demand from advertisers that drove an increase in advertising revenue per timeline view of 43% in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase in timeline views was driven by a 30% increase in average MAUs and a 19% increase in the user engagement levels of MAUs, as measured by timeline views per MAU, in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase in advertising revenue per timeline view was primarily driven by a 327% increase in ad engagements per timeline view, partially offset by a 67% decrease in average cost per ad engagement in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase in ad engagements per timeline view, combined with the increase in timeline views, resulted in a 561% increase in the number of ad engagements in 2013 compared to 2012. Advertising revenue also benefited from sales of our Promoted Products on our mobile applications as well as from an increase in international revenue. In 2013, data licensing and other revenue increased by 48% compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in data licensing revenue. This increase in data licensing revenue was primarily attributable to a 27% net increase in licensing fees from existing data partners in 2013 compared to 2012, and to a lesser extent from an increase in licensing fees from new data partners. 2012 Compared to 2011. Revenue in 2012 increased by $210.6 million compared to In 2012, advertising revenue increased by 247% compared to 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of our advertising service offerings in the second half of 2011 and the first half of 2012, as well as a 59% increase in average MAUs in 2012 compared to 2011. We expanded our advertising service offerings through the introduction of Promoted Tweets in all user timelines in October 2011 and Promoted Products on mobile applications in February 2012. In 2012, data licensing revenue increased by 66% compared to 2011. The increase in data licensing revenue was primarily attributable to a 51% net increase in licensing fees from existing data partners in 2012 compared to 2011, and to a lesser extent from an increase in licensing fees from new data partners. Cost of Revenue 2013 Compared to 2012. In 2013, cost of revenue increased by $138.0 million compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to a $64.6 million increase in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by an increase in average employee headcount and recognition of stock-based compensation expense triggered by our initial public offering, a $34.4 million increase in depreciation expense related to capital leases for additional server and networking equipment, a $28.0 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs due to the continued expansion of our real estate footprint and increase in support functions, and a $14.8 million increase in data center costs related to our co-located facilities. These increases were partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets. 2012 Compared to 2011. In 2012, cost of revenue increased by $67.0 million compared to 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a $28.9 million increase in depreciation expense related to additional server and networking equipment capital leases, a $14.0 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, a $10.0 million increase in data center costs related to our co-located facilities, a $7.8 million increase in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by an increase in average employee headcount and a $6.3 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses. In 2011, the investors in our Series G convertible preferred stock financing commenced a tender offer to purchase shares of our common stock and Series A through Series F convertible preferred stock from our employees, consultants and other stockholders. The tender offer closed in September 2011, and we recorded $34.7 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the excess of the price per share of our common stock paid to our employees and consultants in the tender offer over the fair value of the tendered shares. This $34.7 million of stock-based compensation expense in 2011 was allocated among cost of revenue, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses in amounts of $1.1 million, $19.1 million, $0.4 million and $14.1 million, respectively. Research and Development 2013 Compared to 2012. In 2013, research and development expenses increased by $475.0 million compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to a $466.7 million increase in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by an increase in average employee headcount and recognition of stock-based compensation expense triggered by our initial public offering, and a $32.3 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to the continued expansion of our real estate footprint and increase in support functions. These increases were partially offset by a $24.0 million increase in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use. 2012 Compared to 2011. In 2012, research and development expenses increased by $38.8 million compared to 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a $21.7 million increase in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by an increase in average employee headcount, and a $23.9 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $6.8 million increase in the capitalization of costs associated with developing software for internal use. Sales and Marketing 2013 Compared to 2012. In 2013, sales and marketing expenses increased by $229.7 million compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to a $176.2 million increase in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by an increase in average employee headcount and recognition of stock-based compensation expense triggered by our initial public offering, a $32.9 million increase in marketing and sales-related expenses and a $20.6 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses due to the continued expansion of our real estate footprint and increase in support functions. 2012 Compared to 2011. In 2012, sales and marketing expenses increased by $60.6 million compared to 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a $34.6 million increase in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by an increase in average employee headcount, a $15.9 million increase in allocated facilities and other supporting overhead expenses and a $10.1 million increase in marketing and sales-related expenses. General and Administrative 2013 Compared to 2012. In 2013, general and administrative expense increased by $64.1 million compared to 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to a $69.2 million increase in personnel-related costs, mainly driven by an increase in average employee headcount and recognition of stock-based compensation expense triggered by our initial public offering, an increase of $10.7 million in fees and costs for professional services, partially offset by a $15.8 million decrease in unallocated facilities and supporting costs, driven by slower headcount growth in the general and administrative function relative to other functional areas. 2012 Compared to 2011. In 2012, general and administrative expense decreased by $6.1 million compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $19.9 million decrease in unallocated facilities and supporting costs, driven by slower headcount growth in the general and administrative function relative to other functional areas, partially offset by a $7.9 million increase in personnel-related costs (which takes into account a $14.1 million charge recorded in 2011 in connection with the 2011 tender offer), mainly driven by an increase in average employee headcount and an increase of $5.9 million in fees and costs for professional services. Excluding the impact of the 2011 tender offer, personnel-related costs increased by $22.0 million in 2012 compared to 2011. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 2013 Compared to 2012. Our benefit for income taxes in 2013 increased by $2.0 million compared to a provision of $0.2 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to the increased income tax benefit arising from acquisitions, partially offset by the increase in income tax expenses in foreign and state jurisdictions. 2012 Compared to 2011. Our provision for income taxes in 2012 increased by $1.7 million compared to an income tax benefit of $1.4 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to the increased tax expenses in foreign jurisdictions and a decrease in income tax benefits arising from acquisitions. Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2013. The unaudited quarterly statement of operations data set forth below have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited annual consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and include, in our opinion, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the financial information contained in those statements. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future. The following quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Costs and expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows:   The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:   The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP net income (loss) for each of the periods indicated:   Quarterly Trends Revenue Spending by advertisers is traditionally strongest in the fourth quarter of each year. Historically, this seasonality in advertising spending has affected our quarterly results with higher sequential advertising revenue growth from the third to the fourth quarter compared to sequential advertising revenue growth from the fourth quarter to the subsequent first quarter. For example, our advertising revenue increased 63%, 45% and 43% between the third and fourth quarters of 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2012 and 2013 increased 37% and 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2012, respectively. In addition, advertising revenue per timeline view increased 31% between the third and fourth quarter of 2012, while advertising revenue per timeline view decreased 13% between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. The rapid growth in our business may have partially masked seasonality to date and the seasonal impacts may be more pronounced in the future. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Cost of revenue increased in every quarter presented primarily due to the continued expansion of our co-located data center facilities and an increase in average employee headcount. Operating expense increased in every quarter presented primarily due to the continued expansion of our facilities and an increase in average employee headcount. In addition, we experienced a varied level of capitalization of research and development expense as a result of the development of software programs and websites for internal use, due to the timing and extent of projects eligible for capitalization. Cost of revenue and operating expenses include significant amounts of stock- based compensation expense. Prior to the closing of our initial public offering in November 2013, we had not recognized any stock-based compensation expense for the Pre-2013 RSUs, because the performance condition had not been satisfied. Upon completion of our initial public offering, we began recording the stock-based compensation expense related to Pre-2013 RSUs, because the satisfaction of the performance condition became probable. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in relation to Pre-2013 RSUs totaled approximately $433.5 million. This amount is comprised of $405.9 million of expense accumulated until the effective date of our initial public offering for awards vested and $27.6 million of subsequent recognition of expense during the year as additional Pre-2013 RSUs continue to vest. Credit Facility In October 2013, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with certain lenders which provides for a $1.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility maturing on October 22, 2018. Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75%. This margin is determined based on our total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. We are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee. Our obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2013, no amounts were drawn under the credit facility. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of our investments in short-term and long-term interest-bearing obligations, including government and investment-grade debt securities and money market funds. As of December 31, 2013, we had $2.23 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $56.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. In addition, we have a revolving unsecured credit facility available to borrow up to $1.0 billion. Prior to our initial public offering, our principal source of liquidity has been private sales of convertible preferred stock with total cash proceeds to us of $759.2 million. Proceeds from our preferred stock financing transactions have been used primarily to fund our operations and acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance, and our credit facility, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our Pre-2013 RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition. The service condition for the majority of the Pre-2013 RSUs is satisfied over a period of four years. The performance condition in connection with our Pre-2013 RSUs was satisfied in February 2014. We have elected to allow our employees who are not executive officers to sell a limited number of shares of our common stock received upon the vesting and settlement of the Pre-2013 RSUs in February 2014 in the public market in order to satisfy their potential income tax obligations related to the vesting and settlement of such awards. In addition, we undertook a net settlement of vested Pre-2013 RSUs held by our executive officers upon satisfaction of the performance condition for the Pre-2013 RSUs in February 2014 and withheld shares and remitted income tax on behalf of the applicable executive officers in cash at the applicable minimum statutory rates. We may net settle RSUs in the future and use cash to pay employees' tax withholding obligations in connection with such settlements. Operating Activities Cash provided by (used in) operating activities consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, stock- based compensation, deferred income taxes and non-cash expense related to acquisitions, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was $1.4 million, an increase in cash inflow of $29.3 million compared to 2012. Cash provided by operating activities was driven by a net loss of $645.3 million, as adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses totaling $708.1 million, of which $600.4 million was related to stock-based compensation expense, and the effect of changes in working capital and other carrying balances that resulted in cash outflow of $61.4 million. Cash used in operating activities in 2012 was $27.9 million, a decrease in cash outflow of $42.7 million compared to 2011. Cash used in operating activities was driven by a net loss of $79.4 million, as adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses totaling $104.8 million and the effect of changes in working capital and other carrying balances that resulted in cash outflow of $53.3 million. Cash used in operating activities in 2011 was $70.6 million, an increase in cash outflow of $21.9 million compared to 2010. Cash used in operating activities was driven by a net loss of $128.3 million, as adjusted for the exclusion of non-cash expenses totaling $86.9 million and the effect of changes in working capital and other carrying balances that resulted in cash outflow of $29.2 million. Investing Activities Our primary investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment, particularly purchases of servers and networking equipment, purchases and disposal of marketable securities, leasehold improvements for our facilities and acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets. Cash used in investing activities in 2013 was $1.31 billion, an increase in cash outflow of $1.36 billion compared to 2012. The increase in cash outflow was due to an increase in the purchases of marketable securities of $1.03 billion, a decrease in the proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $0.25 billion and a $0.08 billion increase in expenditure on other investing activities, including business combinations, purchases of intangible assets, purchases of property and equipment and restricted cash. Cash provided by investing activities in 2012 was $49.4 million, an increase in cash inflow of $374.3 million compared to 2011. The increase in cash inflow was due to the increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities of $449.5 million and a reduction in use of cash as acquisition consideration of $17.4 million. Such increases in cash inflow were partially offset by increased purchases of marketable securities of $55.0 million and property and equipment of $39.1 million. Cash used in investing activities in 2011 was $324.9 million, an increase in cash outflow of $373.8 million compared to 2010. The increase in cash outflow was due to an increase in purchases of marketable securities of $439.9 million, an increase in cash used as acquisition consideration of $17.4 million and an increase in purchases of property and equipment of $5.9 million. Such increases in cash outflow were partially offset by the increase of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $93.9 million. We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2014 of approximately $330 million to $390 million, a portion of which we will finance through capital leases, as we continue to expand our co-located data centers and our office facilities. Financing Activities Our primary financing activities consisted of private sales of convertible preferred stock, capital lease financing and stock option exercises by employees and other service providers. Cash provided by financing activities in 2013 was $1.94 billion, an increase of $1.98 billion in cash inflow compared to 2012. The increase in cash inflow was primarily due to net proceeds of $2.02 billion from issuance of common stock in connection with our initial public offering and a slight increase in proceeds from option exercises, partially offset by an increase in repayments of capital lease obligations and payroll tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards. Cash used in financing activities in 2012 was $37.1 million, an increase in cash outflow of $517.3 million compared to 2011. The increase in cash outflow was due to the absence of equity financing transactions, an increase in repayments of capital lease obligations and a decrease in proceeds from option exercises. Cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was $480.2 million, an increase in cash inflow of $365.9 million compared to 2010. The increase in cash inflow was due to increased equity financing and an increase in proceeds from option exercises, partially offset by an increase in repayments of capital lease obligations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any such arrangements in 2013, 2012 or 2011. Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments consist of obligations under capital and operating leases for equipment, office space and co-located data center facilities. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we had liabilities of $15.9 million related to uncertain tax positions. Due to uncertainties in the timing of potential tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table. We also have $18.1 million of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2013, primarily related to our bandwidth and other services arrangements. These commitments are generally due within one to two years. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or operating results would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. Revenue Recognition We generate the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services with the balance coming from data licensing and other arrangements. We generate our advertising revenue primarily from the sale of our three Promoted Products: (i) Promoted Tweets, (ii) Promoted Accounts and (iii) Promoted Trends. Promoted Tweets and Promoted Accounts are pay-for- performance advertising products priced through an auction. Promoted Trends are featured by geography and offered on a fixed-fee-per-day basis. Advertisers are obligated to pay when a user engages with a Promoted Tweet or follows a Promoted Account or when a Promoted Trend is displayed. Users engage with Promoted Tweets by expanding, retweeting, favoriting or replying to Tweets or following the account that tweets a Promoted Tweet. These products may be sold in combination as a multiple element arrangement or separately on a stand-alone basis. Fees for these advertising services are recognized in the period when advertising is delivered as evidenced by a user engaging with a Promoted Tweet, as captured by a click, following a Promoted Account or through the display of a Promoted Trend on our platform. Data licensing revenue is generated based on monthly service fees charged to the data partners over the period in which Twitter data is made available to them. Revenue is recognized only when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the price is fixed or determinable; (3) the service is performed; and (4) collectability of the related fee is reasonably assured. While the majority of our revenue transactions are based on standard business terms and conditions, we also enter into non-standard sales agreements with advertisers and data partners that sometimes involve multiple elements. For arrangements involving multiple deliverables, judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each deliverable. When neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price exists, we use our best estimate of selling price (BESP) to allocate the arrangement consideration on a relative selling price basis to each deliverable. The objective of BESP is to determine the selling price of each deliverable when it is sold to advertisers on a stand-alone basis. In determining BESPs, we take into consideration various factors, including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, sales volume, geographies, pricing strategies and market conditions. Multiple deliverable arrangements primarily consist of combinations of our pay-for-performance products, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts, which are priced through an auction, and Promoted Trends, which are priced on a fixed-fee-per day per geography basis. For arrangements that include a combination of these products, we develop an estimate of the selling price for these products in order to allocate any potential discount to all advertising products in the arrangement. The estimate of selling price for pay-for-performance products is determined based on the winning bid price; and the estimate of selling price for Promoted Trends is based on Promoted Trends sold on a stand-alone basis and/or separately priced in a bundled arrangement by reference to a list price by geography which is approved periodically. We believe the use of BESP results in revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction and allocates the arrangement consideration on a relative selling price basis to each deliverable. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as any related interest or penalties. Our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, state taxes, certain benefits realized in recording the tax effects of business combinations, and the recording of U.S. valuation allowance. Our future provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted, which includes a reinstatement of the federal research and development credit for the tax year ended December 31, 2012. Our consolidated financial statements reflected the effect of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 in 2013, the reporting period of enactment. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in 2013 due to our U.S. valuation allowance position. Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees and other service providers is estimated based on the option’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Black-Scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares that are subject to stock options that are expected to vest. We estimate the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees and other service providers. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly. Stock-based compensation expense for employees is recorded net of estimated forfeiture on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock options granted have a contractual term of ten years and generally vest over four years. Stock-based compensation expense for other service providers is remeasured at each reporting period as services are performed. We historically issued restricted Class A junior preferred stock subject to a lapsing right of repurchase to certain continuing employees in connection with acquisitions. The lapsing of the right of repurchase is dependent on the respective employee’s continued employment with us during the requisite service period, which is generally four years from the issuance date. We have the option to repurchase the unvested shares upon termination of employment prior to the right of repurchase lapsing. The fair value of the restricted Class A junior preferred stock issued to employees is recorded as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. These shares of restricted Class A junior preferred stock were historically included as part of other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of Class A junior preferred stock to common stock in connection with our initial public offering resulted in reclassification of these liabilities to additional paid-in-capital. The fair value of these shares was remeasured at each reporting period until the restricted Class A junior preferred stock was converted. The unamortized expense based on the final remeasurement performed on the date of conversion will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining requisite service period. Our stock-based compensation expense for RSUs is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of our common stock. Under our 2007 Plan, we have granted RSUs to domestic and international employees and other service providers. The Pre-2013 RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition. The service condition for a majority of the Pre-2013 RSUs is satisfied over a period of four years. The performance condition was satisfied in February 2014 pursuant to the terms of the Pre-2013 RSUs. Prior to the closing of our initial public offering in November 2013, we had not recognized any stock-based compensation expense for the Pre-2013 RSUs, because the performance condition had not been satisfied. As the satisfaction of the performance condition became probable upon completion of our initial public offering for the Pre-2013 RSUs for which the service condition had been satisfied as of such date, we recorded the cumulative stock-based compensation expense for these RSUs during the three months ended December 31, 2013, using the accelerated attribution method. Post-2013 RSUs are not subject to a performance condition in order to vest. The service condition for a majority of the Post-2013 RSUs is satisfied over a period of four years. Under the terms of our 2007 Plan, the shares underlying Post-2013 RSUs that satisfy the service condition are to be delivered to holders no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the calendar year the service condition is satisfied, but no earlier than August 15, 2014. The stock-based compensation expense associated with the Post-2013 RSUs is recorded net of estimated forfeiture on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2013, we recorded $433.5 million of cumulative stock-based compensation expense related to the Pre-2013 RSUs on that date, and an additional $158.6 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the Pre-2013 RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. In addition to stock-based compensation expense associated with the Pre-2013 RSUs, as of December 31, 2013, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $998.9 million related to other outstanding equity awards, after giving effect to estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. Further, we made grants of equity awards after December 31, 2013, and we have unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $44.5 million related to such equity awards, after giving effect to estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately four years. Summary of Projected Stock-Based Compensation Expense, Net of Estimated Forfeitures Business Combinations We account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations. The purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date, including estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets, estimated fair value of stock awards assumed from the acquirees that are included in the purchase price, estimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed from the acquirees, and determination of the fair value of contractual obligations, where applicable. The estimates of fair value require management to also make estimates of, among other things, future expected cash flows, discount rates or expected costs to reproduce an asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\n",
